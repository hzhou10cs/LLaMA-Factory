Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Alright, so we are officially in week two of the study."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Were you able to get to lesson two, healthy eating?"
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,I did earlier in the week and I'll actually open it again because I remember all that was in it.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"Yeah, do you happen to remember anything that kind of stuck out to you or did you learn anything"
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I didn't remember too much new.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I think it had the usual substitute beans in and try to cut.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I remember there was something about food substitutions.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"Okay, yeah, it just basically had some substitutions, you know, with the fat grams, things like that, maybe choosing some lower fat options."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"And when you're buying foods, you know, just some labels to pay attention to."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"So, you know, if you have time..."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Just going over that so we can kind of focus on staying within your goals.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Let's see, your previous SMART goal, you had said you wanted to cut down on portions, so instead of eating a full plate of food, eating half a plate."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,How's that been going?
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,That's been going okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"I had, let's see, there were some points when, let's see, I did eat a bit differently this week than last week because I was"
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,in a weekend or a few days.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,But some foods I did kind of eat too much.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,It was actually kind of hard to eat such a small amount.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"Then let's go ahead and go over your data and kind of see, you know, how you did there."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"I saw that you recorded at least 1000 calories, 4 out of the 7 days."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,Looks like you met your calorie goal 3 of those days and your fat gram goal 1 of those days.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,So overall recording is a little bit spotty.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,It would be best to have something a little more consistent just so I can kind of see where we need to improve.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"But on those days where you did record, generally it looks like you're doing not too bad with the calories."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Fat grams though, maybe we might have to make some substitutions there."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Have you been thinking about making any substitutions at all?
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"So before we got disconnected, I had just mentioned making some substitutions in order to stay within that 50 grams of fat your goal."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Have you thought about any substitutions that you can maybe make in an effort to kind of lower your fat gram intake?
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"Mostly what the plan has been is to eat mostly legume-based dishes, which..."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"I was doing, although this week I had, it was a combination of leftovers and going to a couple of events, I ended up eating a bit differently than usual."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"But, yeah, in general, it's, first week I was eating salmon plus legume-based foods, and probably this week I just do the legume-based stuff."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"Yeah, is that just kind of like a personal choice?"
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"I think, um, the salmon is definitely, you know, high in fat, although it is, you know, good fat."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Um, when your body is storing fat for weight gain and weight loss, it doesn't really differentiate between good and bad fat."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,So cutting down on the salmon will definitely help.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"Um, and I see a lot of butter as well."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So maybe cutting back on that a little bit, I think would definitely help there."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,Does that sound reasonable?
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,It might.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"It's, uh, I'm"
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"I'm, let's see, I think the butter, what I'm usually doing is I'm putting something like half a stick of butter in whatever the beans or the lentils are and just eating that over several days, so I'm not sure."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"The other thing I am not sure if I'm doing, although it's hard to check, is if I'm over-underestimating certain things, but, and maybe if it's like, I don't know if it's a lot of butter, like, the reason the butter will show up a lot is because I am just putting a small amount in there, but I can certainly try cutting that out and, uh,"
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,you definitely don't have to cut it out by any means maybe just kind of reducing so instead of like half a stick you could do like a third of a stick you know yeah just cutting down on that but again I think if you record every day because there are a few days you know where you're just not recording anything at all it would definitely help to see overall where we need to improve okay
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,physical activity.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Over this past week, I saw two days recorded."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,You did a total of 172 minutes.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 244.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,That should be about right.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,So it looks like we are three pounds down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"So that's a little bit faster than we would like, but you are still very early on in the study, so your body is adjusting a little bit."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"Also, I see a little bit of fluctuation"
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"throughout the week, so maybe, you know, as we progress, we can see kind of where we land on our next call, okay?"
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,That sounds good.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"I was wondering about that, actually, because I'm like, is the scale a bit funny or what?"
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"It seems like it's not for that a lot, but there it happens."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"All right, then, for that next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 3."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,That one is called Adding Activity to Your Day.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Get in more exercise.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,How many days a week generally would you like to do physical activity?
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"All of them, but I'm guessing you'll say something like five."
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,And then for our call next week.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Same time.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,Same day and time.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,That works.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"Then I will talk to you next week on the 3rd, okay?"
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,Sounds good.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Have a great weekend.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6030.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Alright, so we are in week three of the study."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Lesson three was called adding activity to your day.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,I got to it earlier on and I don't remember a lot of what was in it.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,"You know, generally you're doing pretty well with the physical activity."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"So, you know, probably just a good reminder there."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"Your previous SMART goal, you had said you want to do five days of physical activity."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"Since the last time we talked, generally it looks like you're doing about four days."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,So last week I saw four days of physical activity.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"You did a total of 350 minutes, so you did hit your 300 minute goal."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"So although you're not, you know, spreading out those minutes as you'd like, it still looks like you're hitting that goal."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,Does that sound accurate?
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"It sounds a bit weird, actually, because I, you know, I'll have to check this, but I thought I'd actually done something every day of the week for about an hour."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"So that sounds a bit weird, although maybe I just didn't record it properly."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"The Fitbit might have just not considered it to be, you know, just might have not recorded it because it wasn't the type of XP that we were looking for."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"But it still looks like you're hitting your goals, so no problem there."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"Looking at your data, it looks like you recorded at least 1,000 calories five out of the seven days, and it does look like you hit your calories"
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"The thing that I wanted to bring up, so your calorie budget is 1,800 calories."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Generally, it looks like you're in the lower 1,000, which is a huge drop from the last time we talked."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Is there any reason for that change?
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"I think there was some kind of leftover food I was finishing eating out the first couple of weeks of the study, and that's pretty much gone now."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,So now it's just
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,There's basically less food.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"So it's like I had some salmon that I was finishing off, and that's finished off now, and there's maybe a couple of other types of food, same deal."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Yeah, you know, your calorie goal is 1,800 calories, so we just want to make sure that you're eating your body enough."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,1800 to 1800 would probably be a good place for you.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"So maybe just consider adding a few more vegetables in or whatever you want, just so you can buff up those calories, okay?"
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,Alright.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Alright.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Your most recent weight, I see 237, is that correct?"
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,So that's actually 7 pounds down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"because, you know, your calorie intake is so low."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"So, again, I just want to stress just bumping up those calories a week."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Is there anything that you want to talk about on this call or any questions that you have?
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Nothing, really."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Then for that next lesson, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 5, that would be great."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Just, I guess, keep up the exercise."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"maybe eat a bit more because what I did this week worked pretty well, at least in terms of me being able to do things day-to-day and fit it into a schedule and such."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,So it's hard to think of any major changes I could do.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"And then for our call next week, so I'm actually not going to be available at this time."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Is there generally another day and time that works for you?
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"Most days, most times work."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Wednesday morning would work.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,Later Thursday would work.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"I guess if you're looking for something specific, I'll say Wednesday 12 o'clock."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"Do you, by any chance, have any availability on Tuesday?"
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Can we talk at 10.30 on Tuesday?
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,Would that be okay?
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,That is perfectly fine.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,Then I'll talk to you next Tuesday the 8th at 10.30.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"Have a great weekend, okay?"
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,Sounds good.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6030.F.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,Alright.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, we are in week four."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Were you able to get to lesson five?
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"Oh, I completely forgot about that."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"We're a little bit ahead anyway, so can you just go ahead and read lesson five for our next call?"
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I will do that.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"And then let's see, your previous SMART goal."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,So you had said you just want to maintain physical activity.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"So looking at that, last week I saw that you did seven days."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,You recorded a total of 668 minutes.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"Your goal is 300 minutes, so you completely blew past that."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,So that's still doing very well.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Looking at your diet component, so since the last time we talked, last Thursday, five days have passed."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,I'm looking at data from the 3rd to the 7th.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all five of those days."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,Looks like you met your calorie goal four of those days.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Didn't quite hit your fat gram goal any of the days though.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,So I know that this is something that we've been talking about a little bit with the fat grams.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,So kind of what did you do last week to kind of keep in track of those?
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,Not anything in particular.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"Do you kind of have an idea of why, you know, those numbers were so high this past week?"
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,There was some restaurants.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"There was some more restaurant food, as I mentioned."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"Okay, so it ate out a lot."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"So kind of thinking back on that, do you feel like there's something that you could have done differently, you know, to kind of help keep you accountable and stay within your goals?"
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Uh, well, some of these were me meeting other people for things, so not so much."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"Some of them, some of the food was just kind of like, yeah, I'm going out and enjoying something for myself."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"So, uh, but yeah, I guess not as much of that."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"If I, if I do it, yeah, if I start doing it a lot, obviously I'll,"
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,hopefully notice in the app and tone it down a bit.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"Yeah, I did see like, you know, consistently it was pretty high, but are you kind of back on track now, you know, sticking to your normal routine?"
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 234.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,That's right.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"So that is three pounds down from last time we checked in, so still steadily losing weight."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"Everything, as always, looks pretty good on my end."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,Is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or anything you wanted to talk about?
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,Nope.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Then, like I said, for our next call, please go ahead and read Lesson 5."
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,Keep up the normal routine and eat out less.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"And then for our call next week, is it okay if we keep this time?"
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"So next Tuesday, the 15th at 1030?"
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,That's perfectly fine.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,"Okay, we are in week five."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,Were you able to get to lesson five?
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,I did.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Any big takeaways from that lesson?
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,Keep exercising over vacation.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,Be less on vacation.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Sorry I knew that before, but certainly when vacation's coming this year, it'll be an extra push to remember that."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,I am not.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Your previous SMART goal, you had said you want to eat out less."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,So how did that go this past week?
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,I did not eat out at all.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,Oh.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,And so were you just cooking your own meals instead?
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"Alright, then let's see."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"Looking at your previous data, another really great week."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories 6 out of the 7 days."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,And then you met your calorie goal 6 of those days and your fat gram goal 3 of those days.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,All 7 days you recorded some type of physical activity.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"You did 744 minutes, so you blew past that 300 minute goal."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"Most recent weight I see is 230, is that correct?"
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,That was yesterday.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Four pounds down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,So still losing weight pretty fast.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,And you actually did surpass your goal for the study.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Really great job on that.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"So for the rest of your time in the study, were you thinking of just continuing to do the same thing?"
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,Or what are your thoughts?
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,The same thing.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,OK.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Then for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 6, and then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?"
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,Just keep going.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"There isn't much that's going to change over my life next week, so no reason to change the goal."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"For our call next week,"
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,What is a good day and time that you would like to talk?
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,We usually talk on Thursdays at 1045.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"Yes, it is."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Then I will talk to you next Thursday, the 24th."
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,Sounds good.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,See you then.
Margaret/6030.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week six, so officially halfway done with this initial part of the study."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Able to get to lesson six, ways to stay motivated."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,I looked through.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"I'd actually forgotten that you'd asked me to do that, so I think I looked through it at some point but don't remember it."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,too many details.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"So really just at this point, we kind of just want to talk about, you know, how you're feeling about your progress, kind of what you want to focus on for the duration of your participation with this initial 12-week kind of program."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"So, so far, you know, you have done really well."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,You've definitely passed your WACL for this study.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"But, you know, just wanted to check in, kind of how are you feeling about your progress?"
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"Uh, generally pretty good."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,Is there anything that you feel like you can improve on?
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"Uh, there's been occasional times when I eat a bit more than I really should."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"I kind of think like, oh, the weight's chopping off, I'm going to go snack on something a bit extra, and then it's like, well, probably not."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"So just in general, watching what you're eating, but otherwise, do you feel like your motivation is okay, that you're still kind of on track?"
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,It's pretty unrealistic to assume that for these 12 weeks you're going to be hitting your goals all 7 days all the time because
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"That's just, you know, we want this to be something that's sustainable."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"And once in a while, you know, there are going to be those slip-ups."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"However, it's just about getting yourself back on track."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"And so far, you know, everything's looking good."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"So just for the remainder of your time in the study, you had just said, you know, you want to continue losing weight."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,Your previous SMART goal.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"So you said you want to stick to the goals, just continuing with that."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Um, for the calories and fat grams, so over this past week, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all six days."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,You met your calorie goal all six of those days and your fat gram goal five of those days.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Physical activity, as always, really great."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,Seven days recorded.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"You did a total of 718 minutes, so really doubling that physical activity goal there."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Um, just out of curiosity, kind of what are you doing for physical activity?"
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Um, some of the physical is a bit overestimated, because what I, um, I, uh, have to walk, well, I have to get to the gym, and I usually walk, so that's probably recording, the zip's probably recording that a bit, but generally what I do is an hour of elliptical most days, and I'll just set the resistance up high and go for about an hour, sometimes a bit over a"
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,And that's what's being recorded.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"And then what's not being recorded is I'll maybe four or five days a week, I'll either do some weightlifting or there's a climbing wall."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,And then sometimes I'll enter and also do some swimming.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"So maybe like 30 minutes of that or 40 minutes of that, expectationally."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,So doing really great.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Do you feel like this level of physical activity is sustainable?
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Usually, yes, although sometimes I'll get a bit, I'll notice I'm getting a bit tired and not quite running as fast, although I'm not sure if that's psychology or physical."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 230.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"So, yeah, that's checking in at the same weight when we talked as last time."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"The reason why I asked about the physical activity is because, you know, a lot of men who usually participate in these programs like to weight lift."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"So we know that, you know, muscle weighs more than fat."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"So if you're really doing that a lot, we might not see your weight shift that much since you'll be gaining more muscle than losing actual fat."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"But, you know, still doing really well since you started in the study, you've lost 17 pounds."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"So as far as I'm concerned, just keep doing what you're doing."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"as long as you feel like that's sustainable, okay?"
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"Then for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 7."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,That one is called Conquering Slip-Ups.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goals to be for this week?
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,Keep going with the same stuff.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"Yeah, let's just... Unless there's really a need to do something different."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,No.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"You know, like I said, everything seems pretty good right now, so we can just go ahead and say just sticking to the goals."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"And then next Tuesday, let's see, that's the 29th at 1030."
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,That's perfectly fine.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,I'll check in with you then.
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"Keep up the good work, okay?"
Margaret/6030.F.w6.8.22.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so week seven, just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,Lesson seven was called Conquering Slip-Ups.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,I did.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"Did you relate to the lesson at all, or did you read anything that you liked?"
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Somewhat, although I've sort of done the things that suggested anyway."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"It's like, okay, I ate a bit more today than I wanted, but screw it, I'll just roll tomorrow."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"Okay, so..."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"Like just kind of even though I was slipping up one day, you know, the next day knowing that it's a new day, you can always start over, things like that?"
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Let's see, your previous SMART goal, so you had said just making sure to stick to the calorie and fat gram goals."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,So let's go ahead and take a look at your data.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,So I saw last week you recorded at least 1000 calories all seven days.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,Looks like you met your calorie goal six of those days.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,So really great job there.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,And then you met your fat gram goal three of those days.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"So fat grams still somewhere that we need to work on something that I've been mentioning on our calls, but not too bad."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"Again, you know, when you are over, it's not outrageous, but maybe just paying a little more attention to that."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Physical activity is always really great.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"You did 712 minutes across seven days, so really surpassing that physical activity goal."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 227.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,That's right.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"So another three pounds down, so just doing really well in general."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,So just another good week.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or anything that you wanted to talk about?
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"Yeah, the two questions I was thinking are..."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"Um, what's the, what I've noticed is a lot of food I eat is either very high fat or very low fat."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"I was wondering, is there a, um, is there a, is there a health reason to watch, a major health reason to watch fat separately than, uh, calories in general?"
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"Or, um, you know, are the eating habits, yeah, because that's basically the question."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"Because mostly what I'm eating is something like,"
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"legume starch, a bit of meat, which seems okay."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"But if it is too much fat and there's a reason to cut it, then obviously I digest that."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,So the reason why we have participants watch their fat grams is just because most of the literature suggests that calories and fat kind of play the biggest role in weight gain and weight loss.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"And also, you know, generally if you lower your calories, you know, your fat gram is going to go down."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"And when just looking at all the macronutrients, looking at carbs, things like that, it just seems that, um, you know, fat is going to be the biggest contributor to weight gain."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Um, of course, you know, everybody's different, um, their bodies kind of work differently, but that's just kind of what the literature suggests."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"So, you know, even though on these calls, I'm always saying, you know, you are going over your fat grams, maybe you want to look at that a little bit."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,It does seem like you're losing weight pretty consistently.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So, you know, always taking that, um,"
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"you know, that general advice, but also making sure you're paying attention to kind of how your own body is working, things like that."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Okay, and then what was your other question?"
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"The other question I had is, what's your protein?"
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,What would you recommend?
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,Do you have any good research when it comes to protein?
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"Because I did actually look it up, and I know it's, depending on where I look, it seems like if I just ate, if I didn't have extra meat, if I just had the"
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"and such, I would either be just barely getting enough protein or maybe getting slightly less, and it depends what people say with exercise and such."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Do people in this study have any opinions on that or any ideas on that?
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"I'm not a nutritionist, so I can't really speak to that."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,intellectual level and it's not really the scope of our study but you know in general protein is important for muscle building to keeping you full things like that so I mean I would pay attention to the levels of protein that you're eating it's always important to eat you know a little bit of everything but you know like I said I can't really speak to that since I don't really have the knowledge on that sorry no problem okay
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"Then for our next call, if you could go ahead and take a look at Lesson 8."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be?
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,Keep doing the same thing.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,These calls are going to get pretty boring.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"Then for our call next week, let's see."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"Next Tuesday is the 5th, and that's going to be at 1030."
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,Is that okay?
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,That's perfectly fine.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,This time works very well.
Margaret/6030.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so a brief call, like always, just to remind you, you are in week eight."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,Were you able to get to lesson eight?
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,Hello?
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"Yeah, I'm here."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"Okay, you're cutting out just a little bit."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"Sorry, so were you able to get to lesson eight?"
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Did you read anything that you liked about it?
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"Um, I did not."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"I think I read it some time ago, but I don't remember too much about it."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"Really, all it was talking about was food cravings and cues, like the title suggested."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"So really, do you feel like you have any food cravings that are particularly difficult for you to overcome?"
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,Um...
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,Not so much.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"I mean, sometimes I'll kind of look at, like, ice cream and such, your typical junk food, and be like, ah, I kind of want some of this."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"And it's like, no, that's right."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,I'm not eating this stuff for a reason.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,We're not eating it much for a reason.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,And then let's see your previous SMART goals.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,So really just wanted to stick to the goals and paying attention to those.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,Just continuing like always.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,So...
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"Looking at your data, last week I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"You met your calorie goal six of those days and your fat gram goal five of those days, so really great recording as always."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"Seven days of physical activity entered, you did 735 minutes, and then most recent weight I see is 220 pounds."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,That's right.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,So that is another two pounds down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,So still doing very well and losing weight.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Was there anything that came up last week that was difficult for you or anything like that?
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Nope.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Nope.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,And how is this week looking?
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,Same as usual.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,Alright.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Then for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 9."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,That one is called Stress Management.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,And what would you like your
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,Just keep going.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"As I said last week, these are going to be pretty boring."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Next Tuesday is going to be the 5th, and that's at 1030."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,That's fine.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"All right, Dylan."
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,I'll check in with you then.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Have a good week.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,Have a good one.
Margaret/6030.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Week 9, just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Lesson 9 was called Stress Management.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,And what did you think of that lesson?
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"As usual, I don't remember it completely, but I think it was pretty familiar based on what I've heard elsewhere."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Um, then let's see."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Um, your SMART goals."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"So you had said you wanted to stick to your goals, just maintaining, um, things like that."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"So, uh, just looking at your past data this week, uh, recording in general was a little bit spotty."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"Is, uh, the app still working?"
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Yeah, it is."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"I think, um, the past few days I've been sick, so I may be... I haven't been..."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,eating as normal and I haven't been doing things as normal.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,Sorry to hear that.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"Um, it is, you know, starting to get a little bit cooler."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,So I guess it is that time of year when everyone starts to get sick.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Um, but let me then just go ahead, uh, go over your data briefly."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"So I said that you record at least a thousand calories, three out of the day, uh, three of the days, excuse me, it looks like you met your calorie goal all three of those days."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"And then your fat gram goal, two of those days."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Um,"
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"Physical activity, so across four days, I saw 551 minutes, so you still met that 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,Most recent weight I see is 225.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,Is that correct?
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Yeah, that's right."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,All right.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"So, you know, despite the recording and your sickness, we're still maintaining from the last time we checked in, so definitely not bad at all."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,Kind of what are you thinking about doing this week to get back on track?
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Let's see, I think once the cold clears up, I get back to exercising and start recording again."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Yeah, the other three days I was following it, and then obviously sore throat and such, I'm not going to be exercising all day."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Right, right."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"Yeah, so are you thinking about doing any physical activity this week?"
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Yeah, once it clears up, I'll just get back to what I was doing before."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,Let's see then.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"So for our next lesson, that one is going to be lesson 10."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,That one is called mindfulness.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,And then what would you like your sparkle to be for the week?
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,Get back to eating normal and exercising when everything clears up.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"And for our call next week, so from now on, I actually have a meeting at 10.30, so I'm going to have to move our coaching call time."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"Generally, though, are you free during this time frame, or do you need a completely different time?"
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,What is your schedule like?
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Tuesday, I'm not available from about 1.30 to..."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Let's see, what is that?"
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"3.30 or so, but other than that, I'm completely available."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"Oh, okay, great."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,So how about 11.30?
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Would that be okay?
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,That's perfectly fine.
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"All right, so then next Tuesday is the 19th, and then we'll check in at 9.30."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"I hope you feel better, and have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"Sure, thank you, and have a good one yourself."
Margaret/6030.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are officially in week one of the study."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"All right, so today we will be going over that lesson that I asked you to read, all of your data entered so far, and then we'll be setting your first SMART goal."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"So lesson one, were you able to get to that one?"
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yeah, I read through it today."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory, just kind of an overview of the study and what the goals are and that kind of thing."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"Yeah, like I said, you know, these first few lessons are very kind of like intro."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"So, you know, if you don't have that much experience with healthy behaviors, it's just going to kind of be review."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"But maybe, you know, you'll take something away from it."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"All right, then we can go ahead and go over your data."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"So since your intervention just started on Monday, I'm only looking at Monday the 26th and yesterday the 27th."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,Uh-huh.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"So it looks like out of both of these days, you did record at least 1,000 calories, which is great."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Remember I had said any day that you don't record at least 1,000 calories is considered incomplete data, so thank you for doing that."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"And then it looks like you met your calorie goal, which is 1,800 calories, one of those days, and your fat gram goal, which is 50 fat grams, one of those days as well."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"So I know you've only been in the study officially for two days, but kind of tell me how it's"
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"Uh, fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"I think, you know, on Monday when I didn't meet my goal, I ate something before I realized how many calories were in it."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"Uh, so I probably need to check things before I eat them."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"So, but, um, otherwise, yeah, it's been going fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Um, I think a lot of people realize that early on as well."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"You know, they'll track the food after they've eaten it and then they realize the foods that they've been eating this entire time weren't exactly"
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"You know, those calories and fat grams can really add up quickly."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,So it's good that you're recognizing that now.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,You can kind of change those habits and get that out of the way early on.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Otherwise, a pretty decent start."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,And then physical activity is looking really great.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"I see two days recorded, a total of 221 minutes."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,Does that sound correct?
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,221 minutes?
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,So I see 133 minutes entered on Monday and then 88 minutes entered yesterday.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"Yeah, it might be doubling it up."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,Because I manually entered my minutes for a couple walks I did yesterday and on Monday.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,Because it didn't look like the smart app was picking up the minutes from the Fitbit.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,So...
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"I have to check my app, the actual Fitbit app, to see how many minutes I have, but it sounds like it's a little high."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,You might want to subtract like 60 minutes out of that.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Okay, yeah."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"There might just be, what we discovered, there might be a little bit of a lag time between the Fitbit and our app."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,Uh-huh.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,our app caught up so it looks like you know there's double what you actually did um so if you just want to go ahead if you want to have you know exact numbers shoot me an email and then we can try changing that from the back end i guess otherwise you know it's not that big of a deal okay um okay and then most recent weight i see is 229 is that correct yes
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,looks like you're a pound down from where you waited on Monday so you know hopefully we can keep that up so so far you know everything is looking very good like I said on that tech call this call is just going to be a little bit short since we don't have a full week's worth of data just yet but is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or anything that you wanted to talk
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"No, I mentioned that things were looking weird on the food blog on Monday, but yesterday and today it seems to be working fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,Just the Monday one looked a little screwy when I was in the smart app.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Yeah, I did tell our tech team about that."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,They said that they were working on it.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"It might be maybe just, you know, since you started on Monday something had happened there, but definitely let me know if it happens again, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Yeah, I know I had some issues with Wi-Fi at home, too, on Monday, so maybe that had to do with it."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"So, in any case, it seems to be working fine now, and I won't manually enter in any more exercise minutes, since it seems to be picking up, but just on a lag or something."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,Wow.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"Okay, our next lesson for next week, just lesson two, that one is called healthy eating."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"This one is kind of just a follow-up to lesson one, you know, just talking about making smart food choices, things like that."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,And then we can go ahead and set your first smart goal.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,So have you ever heard of smart goal setting?
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"No, I have not."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,These are just meant to be kind of a space where you're going to set one goal every week.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,These are going to be behavioral-based goals that you feel like will help propel you to a larger overall goal.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"So when we are setting these goals, we kind of like them to be very specific."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"So a specific behavioral goal, for example, I will try to walk for 75 minutes this week instead of something vague."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,I will just try to get exercise.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"And we try to make sure, you know, that they are attainable."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"So, you know, we do want these to be motivating goals."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"So, you know, the more that you achieve those, you'll hopefully gain more motivation from that."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"And of course, you know, that timeframe is going to be between this call or this week and next week."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"So kind of keeping that in mind, is there something that you'd like to work on during this one week period?"
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,I'm trying to think of a good one.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"I mean, I've been probably doing about 30 minutes a day of walking, probably trying to make sure I can do that for the rest of the week, or at least for the work week."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"So walking 30 minutes every day during the work week, is that correct?"
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"All right, and then let's see."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"For our call next week, did you want to talk on the same day at the same time?"
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"Yeah, that's fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,"Okay, so that's going to be next week, July 5th at 1115, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"All right, then I'll talk to you then."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,Have a good week.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"Okay, bye-bye."
Margaret/6032.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to lessons 9 and 10?
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Yes, I did."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Anything stand out to you in either of those two lessons?
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"Well, the stress management lesson really kind of, I think, helps because I do get a lot of stress at work sometimes."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"In fact, a few years ago, I think..."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"We had a really rough patch at work, and I think that's a lot of what caused me to gain weight in the first place."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"But, yeah, I mean, I've seen some things about, you know, relaxation techniques and stuff like that before as well."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Yeah, do you feel like food is kind of, you know, that comforting factor when you're stressed out?"
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,Sometimes.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"And I think this week was kind of a little stressful and I probably didn't, you know, achieve my goals as well as I should have."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Your SMART goal.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,So we talked about trying to lower those fat grams.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,So trying to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,So let's
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,data.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,So it has been eight days since we last talked.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,Over these past eight days you did record at least a thousand calories all of those days.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,Looks like you met your calorie goal three of those days and your fat gram goal three of those days.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,So definitely there were quite a few days where you were over your calorie goal.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,So as you had just mentioned do you feel like it was mostly due to the stress or kind of what was going on there?
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"I think a lot of it was due to the stress and maybe some of it is just, you know, me becoming a little complacent."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"But I think, you know, I just need to back down again and get back on track."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"I kind of lost my edge, I guess you could say."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Yeah, if you remember a while ago, a few lessons back, there was that one lesson about slips."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"So something we really want to avoid, you know, it's normal to slip up."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,That's just part of any behavior change process.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,But we really want to avoid those slides and falls.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"So thinking about, you know, this upcoming weekend, especially since it is going to be a long weekend, you know, just for the rest of your time during this intervention."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"But let's just focus on this week, I guess."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,Kind of what do you want to do to kind of get yourself back on track?
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"Well, I mean, it might be a little difficult this weekend because we're going camping again."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,And I'm not sure what kind of food they provide for us.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"I mean, I have some, like, PB&J alternatives and stuff like that, but nothing, like, too healthy."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"So, I mean, I'll just try to..."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,focus on any fruits and vegetables they have and try to minimize the calories or add food.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"But starting Tuesday, I'm basically back in my comfort zone for the next few weeks, so I should be able to stick to it a little better."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Let's, yes, I do know that you did talk about the camping trip again."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Something that I just wanted to remind you, you know, definitely I know it's hard to stick to your goals, especially in those situations where you have really no control over what you're eating."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"You know, just keep in mind, you know, not to go overboard, right?"
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,It's not an excuse to just kind of eat whatever you want.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Just still paying attention, you know, to the portion size and that feeling of fullness so you're not overeating too much."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,Does that make sense?
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"So yeah, let's just kind of see how that goes and kind of where we land next week with the nutrition."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,But physical activity was a little bit low this past week as well.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,So I saw across six days you did 273 minutes.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,So you didn't quite hit your physical activity goal either.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Your goal for this week is 257 minutes.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"It looks like you've already gotten some physical activity in this week, which is good."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Do you feel like
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Yeah, I mean, we're going to be doing a lot of walking over the next few days with the camping trip."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,I might need it before Tuesday.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"I think, yeah, and then once I get back to work on Tuesday, I usually go work out during lunchtime, and that'll add up the minutes as well, so."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,Just trying to get back on track with that.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"Not too worried, though."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Your most recent weight I see is 209.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,So that's maintaining from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"You know, you are still below your weight goal, still doing very well."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,So not too worried.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"Just want to prevent, you know, any big slip-ups or any, you know, unnecessary weight gain."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"Yeah, I mean, I've been in this."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"I've been as low as, like, 207 at one point."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"So I think, you know, I want to get down to, like, 205 or below by the end of this."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"Yeah, all right."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"For our call next week, Lesson 11, balance your thoughts."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be?
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,I think get back on track and try to lose between one and two pounds by next week.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"Yeah, really paying attention to the calories and fat grams and the physical activity."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"And then let's see, next week, next Thursday, that's going to be the 7th at 1130."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,Is that going to be okay for our call?
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"Yeah, that'll be fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"Have a good weekend, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,Thanks.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w10.9.1.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, we are in week 11."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Lesson 11 was called Balance Your Thoughts.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Okay, and what did you think of that lesson?"
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Well, I think, I mean, you know, it makes sense and stuff."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I don't know if I really had any problems with that.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"So, you know, on occasion I kind of beat myself up for, you know, slipping off the wagon, so to speak."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"Okay, and then let's see, your previous SMART goal, so really trying to get back on track, paying attention to those calories and fat grams."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"And I know that this past week, or this past weekend, you went on another camping trip."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"So with all that kind of going on, how was it trying to meet these goals?"
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"Well, I think, you know, the calories and fat grams is kind of difficult because, like I said, the food,"
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"was kind of already, you know, prepared and made for us."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"So I tried to, you know, eat healthy, but it wasn't always easy."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"I think I probably blew away the activity goal, though, because, you know, even just walking around probably did it, and then I also did some..."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,kayaking and pedal boating and stuff like that that I probably didn't even record so but I think overall I did okay I still lost weight despite probably exceeding the calorie goals so yeah so looking at your data specifically across six days where you recorded at least a thousand calories you met your calorie goal three of those days and your fat gram goal one of those days so
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"Looks like calorie goals about half the time, but fat grams is really where you struggled a little bit."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"Physical activity, just like you said, across seven days, you did 415 minutes."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"Your goal last week was 257, so you definitely met that."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"And then just to remind you, your goal this week is 300 minutes."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Most recent weight, I see 206."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,So that is actually three pounds down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"Definitely seen some weight loss, you know, despite the calorie and fat grams being a little bit high over the weekend."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"But now you're back into your normal routine, I assume, and the holiday weekend is over."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"So with this upcoming week, kind of how are you refocusing yourself?"
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"I'm just, you know, trying to get back into my routine, trying to, you know, limit the fat calories especially and, you know,"
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,Basically get back to being more healthy.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"Our lesson for our call next week, that's going to be number 12."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,That one is weight loss plateau.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,So pretty self-explanatory from the title.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goals to be?
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,I think...
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"Just continue to try to, you know, meet the calorie and pack gram goals and, you know, continue to try to lose weight."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Yeah, and then for our call next week, let's see, next Thursday, that is the 14th at, I do have a conflict at 1130."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Is there another time that works for you?
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"I mean, we can do it either Wednesday or Friday at 1130, if that's better."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,Let me see.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Next Wednesday, the 13th at 1130 is fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"And I just want to let you know our call next week will be your last one, so it's going to be just a little bit longer because, you know, we kind of just want to think about, you know, everything that you learned from this initial part of the intervention, kind of end on a high note, talk about some other things and kind of how you're going to go moving forward."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"All right, sounds good."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"All right, great."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,Then I will talk to you next week.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"All right, thank you."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w11.9.7.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"Hey, Mitch."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"So, week 12, just to remind you, you did agree to be on your regular agenda, you know, the lessons and the homework, or the lessons, the SMART goal and your data, and then just kind of want to wrap up a little bit, just talking about what you should expect and kind of what's going to happen after these."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,1,patient,Okay?
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"So, what's going to follow?"
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yeah, I..."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I think it makes sense.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I tried it in the past when I tried to lose weight.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,I always seemed to hit like a plateau at some point.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"And I think over the last few weeks, I've kind of, I would say, kind of quasi-plateaued a little in that I haven't been losing as much weight as I have in the past."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"And part of that may be because I've been flipping a little, and part of it might be actual plateau, so..."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"Yeah, so like you said, you know, plateaus are pretty normal in this process."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"So not, you know, anything to be extremely worried about."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,It's just kind of about persevering and kind of pushing through that plateau.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Just looking at your data, it seems that you're doing fine still."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,So that's good.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,Your SMART goal was also related to meeting your goals.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"So in general, you had just kind of talked about wanting to get back on track, meeting your calorie and fat gram goals again after we got a little off track there."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,So moving ahead.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"You met your calorie and fat gram goal five of those days, so really great job there."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,Did you find it difficult at all trying to kind of get back on track to meeting those goals?
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"I mean, it was a little difficult, you know, because, you know, they had, like, a party here for one of the employees getting married, so there was, like, cake involved and,"
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Things like that, you know, where it's like, okay, if I have this piece of cake, how am I going to cut out for dinner?"
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"But otherwise, I think I did try to stick to it as well as could be done."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"Okay, and then, let's see, physical activity, seven days recorded, 328 minutes, so you did meet your 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,That's a really great job there.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"And then, let's see, most recent weight I am seeing, 205, is that correct?"
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Yep, so that is a pound down from last time we checked in, so still doing really great with everything there."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Let's see here.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"So, kind of just wanted to take some time now to talk about"
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,The next step.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,So do you kind of remember what's going to happen after your three-month assessment?
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,I think there's a six-month and then a 12-month assessment.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"Correct, yes."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,So we do know that things are going to be a little bit different since you're only going to be able to use the app now.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,So the coaching calls are no longer available to you.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,How are you feeling?
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"I think, you know, as long as I try to stick to that, you know, calorie goal and fat gram goal, I should be all right."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Yeah, are you – oops, sorry, go ahead."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"Yeah, I don't really have a problem exercising or getting into activity in a typical week."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"Yeah, and then were you still interested in tracking on a device?"
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"Yeah, I mean, I'll probably use my current Fitbit."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"I got the Fitbit HR, so I'll probably use that to keep tracking."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"I may not use your app because, you know, I could be using up a lot of space on my limited space phone."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"So I may just use the Fitbit app itself, so..."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Yeah, so generally, we just want people to be aware that now might be a good time to kind of think about what was working for you and kind of what wasn't."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"So in these upcoming months, you can kind of really focus on either maintaining or continuing to lose weight, whatever it is."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,It's up to you.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,know although you won't have these coaching calls that doesn't mean that you can't check in you know with yourself every week kind of keeping yourself accountable um and also you know setting a smart goal if you wanted for yourself you know you can do that on your own as well um and uh just wanted to ask about the fitbit so i remember you had said the one that we gave you doesn't work did you happen to
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"No, I still have it."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,I'll be returning it next week.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,It wasn't the Fitbit itself that didn't work.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"I think the battery got, the one battery died on me and the other one got corroded, so I had no replacement batteries."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"Okay, all right."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"Okay, and then, of course, there are no more lessons for us to read since there are no more calls."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"However, you will still have access to that website, so if you ever feel the need, you can always go back and look at those if you'd like."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Do you want to set one last SMART goal for yourself?
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"I'll just keep it up because I still want to, you know, lose weight, you know, by the time the six-month assessment rolls around."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"Then I just wanted to say, you know, congratulations for all the progress that you've made so far."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"You know, you've lost 26 pounds, actually, since you started three months ago."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"So that's really great, you know."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"You know, we just encourage that you queue up the good work, and it has been an absolute pleasure talking to you."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"You know, thank you so much for being consistent with the study."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"You know, you've been a really great participant, and I just want to wish you all the best of luck in the future, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"Well, and thank you for, you know, all your support and the calls."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Of course.
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"All right, then we will see you at your sixth month."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Like I said, good luck with everything."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"Or your three months, excuse me."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"Yeah, my three months is next week."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"All right, thanks."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6032.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,Bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week two of the study."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Were you able to get to lesson two, healthy eating?"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,Did you have any thoughts about that lesson?
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Yeah, I mean, in general, it kind of makes sense."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,It's just a matter of putting theory into practice.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Well, the last couple days were too good with the holiday and everything."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"But in general, I think I've been doing better."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"You know, it's unfortunate that that holiday appeared so early on during your participation."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"But, you know, thinking about kind of what went on during that holiday, kind of what was the most difficult part for you?"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"Oh, it's just avoiding the, you know, bad food."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"I mean, you know, we went to a little barbecue with some friends and, you know, they had obviously pork and chips and all that stuff."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"And just, you know, hard to say no sometimes."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"Yeah, we definitely understand that."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"It's not an easy thing to do, especially when you're in those social situations."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"You know, right now it's pretty early on in the study, like I said, so you might have not built up that understanding or really thought of other strategies to help you avoid those."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"But kind of in general, thinking about what went on, can you think of some ideas or maybe just think of one thing that you could have done differently to kind of help you avoid those?"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Well, I mean, they had fruit salad."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,I probably could have eaten more of that instead of munching on chips or chosen other healthy options.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Yeah, and one thing that we like to stress about those social occasions or those holidays is that, of course, by no means do you have to deprive yourself of those foods completely, but we do definitely suggest just finding a balance between those unhealthy and healthy foods."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"And also, you know, just making sure that those choices don't carry on throughout the rest of the week."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"Of course, you know, even if one day you find yourself going over, just making sure that the rest of the time, you know, you're staying on track, trying to stay within your goals."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"So keeping that in mind, have you thought of ways that you can keep yourself accountable this week, trying to make sure that you do meet that calorie and"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Well, I think, you know, with the holiday behind me, it should be better because now I'm kind of more back into my daily routine and I can, you know, monitor myself better."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"And, you know, when I eat at home, you know, my wife usually makes healthier things than what we do when we go out or whatever, whenever we're at a party."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"All right, then."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,Let's...
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Go ahead and go over your SMART goal then.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"So your SMART goal, you had said you wanted to walk 30 minutes every day during the work week."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"So last week, how did that go?"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,I think I hit that goal at least for the five days I wanted to.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Alright, so then let's go over your data."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,So now we have one full week of data to look at.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Just to remind you, I'm looking at the 26th to the 2nd of July."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"So looking at this seven week period, it looks like you did record at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,And then it looks like you met your calorie goal four of those days and your fat gram goal four of those days as well.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,So definitely not bad at all starting out.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,Have you kind of begun to identify spaces in which you can improve and make different choices?
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"Yeah, I mean, in general, when I'm at work, you know, it's hard to find healthy options, and I don't always bring a lunch, so I've been trying to go to, you know,"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"Subway and get, like, a healthy kind of lunch or, you know, other places where I could get a healthy lunch or that kind of thing."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,And then let's see.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Physical activity looked really great.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,I saw six days total recorded.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"You did a total of 396 minutes, so completely blew that 60-minute goal out of the water."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 227.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,From July 2nd?
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"No, just today."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Oh, yeah, that's correct."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"So, yeah, that is actually still two pounds down from the last time we checked in."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"So, you know, even despite that holiday that just passed us, it still looks like you are losing weight, which is great."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"So, yeah, so far so good."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Everything is looking okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"So you said that, you know, you're in your normal routine this week."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"Is there anything coming up that you feel like will be a barrier to you, or do you feel like you're kind of back on track completely?"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"Well, I think, I mean, it's not coming up soon, but our vacation when we go down to Orlando probably could be a barrier."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"You know, we're going to be at Universal, and we're going to be on their meal plan, so we'll be eating at their restaurants and everything."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"I don't know what kind of healthy things they have on the menu, but I'm hoping that I can try to plan out some of that in advance or look at their menus and see if I can figure out what healthy things they have that I can eat while I'm there."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"Yeah, that pre-planning is great."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Can you remind me of when you'll be down there again?
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,It's the week of the 12th.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,I think we're leaving on Sunday and coming back Thursday.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"So, yeah."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Do you mean next week, July 10th?"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"No, no, no."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,August.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"Oh, August."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"So, we still have a lot of time to kind of prepare for that and talk about that."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"You know, I can definitely understand why that might be a concern, especially somewhere like Disney World."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"However, by that time, you know, we should already identify some strategies."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"So,"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"Yeah, and I think the other one coming up is I got a camping trip with my son last weekend in July the 28th."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"Is that something that the two of you have planned together, or is it... It's through the Cub Scouts, so it's all kind of they have the meals there and not really the best food, let alone healthy."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,But...
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,like a lot of opportunities you know for you to put a lot of your habits into practice which is you know a good thing definitely it helps you stay accountable with yourself kind of make sure that you know everything that you're learning here isn't you know in theory you're actually able to put it to good use so
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,We will definitely be going over a lot more strategies.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,Some of the lessons as well will help you kind of build up a repertoire for those.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"So if you go ahead for our next call, read that next lesson."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"That's number three, adding activity to your day."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"At this point, it doesn't seem like physical activity is really a problem for you, but maybe this one might give you some other ideas to help you get in that physical activity."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,And then we can go ahead and set our next SMART goal.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,So did you have an idea of what you wanted that to be between now and our next call?
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"I think, well, what's a good goal?"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,Probably try to eat more
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,fruit and vegetables.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"Yeah, getting in more servings of fruits and vegetables is great."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,"Yep, and that'll definitely help keep those fat grams low, which I see might, which looks like, at least on my end, a little more of a problem for you than the calories, so hopefully we can keep that number down."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"All right, then, for our call next week, did you want to keep the same day and time?"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,That would be the 12th at 11.15?
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,"Yeah, that should be fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,So we are officially in week three of the study.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Like always, we'll be going over that lesson, your smart goal, and all of your data."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"That lesson was number three, adding activity to your day."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Unfortunately, not yet."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"Okay, no problem."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,If you could just go ahead then.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"I'm going to ask you to read two for our next call, lesson three and four, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"previous SMART goal, you had said you want to try to get in more servings of fruits and vegetables during your meals."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,How did that go?
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,I think pretty good.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,I think I was able to cut down the amount of fat per day a bit.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"Alright, then we can go ahead and briefly go over your data."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,So
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,1800 calories and then your fatgram goal is 50 grams of fat so I saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories all seven days and then it looks like you met your calorie goal two of those days and your fatgram goal three of those days so to remind you again this is from the third to the ninth so do you want to tell me a little bit how it has been trying to
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Yeah, I think, you know, with the holiday, that was the most difficult time."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,Right.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,And I think we kind of touched on that last week.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,Right.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"You know, we were out with friends and had a barbecue and it's just, you know, too many bad things around."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,But I think I did a lot better after the holiday.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,I did have one other day when we met up with some friends and I...
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,ended up eating pizza when I shouldn't have.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"But otherwise, I think I did fairly good."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Great, yeah."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Has anything been eye-opening or surprising to you so far while you've started to enter food?
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"No, I mean, not surprising."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"I mean, I know which foods I shouldn't be eating, but sometimes it's hard to stay awake."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Yes, it definitely sounds like those social engagements are the most challenging for you."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,So I just would encourage you at this point to maybe think a little bit about those times where you are going out.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"It's very early on in the study, so I don't want to touch on it too much just yet."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"But thinking of some ways to prepare for those occasions if those do happen, to happen quite frequently."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"If, you know, we see that, you know, those having more regularly, of course, we can go over some strategies."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"But, you know, in general, always trying to kind of just plan ahead."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"You know, it sounds like you have a pretty good working knowledge of, you know, the healthy foods that you should stick to."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"And like you said, most of the days it seems like tracking isn't going too terribly."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,You're generally like right at that 1800 calorie goal.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,So we'll just kind of monitor that.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,And then physical activity looked great.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"You recorded six days, did a total of 412 minutes."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,So you did meet that 300 minute goal.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,So really great job there.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 225.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,So that is down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"So still seeing some progress, which is great."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"So, you know, definitely overall doing very well with the physical activity."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"Still some room for improvement with the calories and fat grams, but again, sounds like you have a bit of a plan for the next week."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"And also, like I said, it's pretty early on in the study, so we'll just monitor that."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Is there anything else that you would like to go over on this call?
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"No, not that I can think of."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,Then we can go ahead.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,And talk about our next call.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"So, again, I'm just going to ask you to read Lesson 3 and 4 for that call."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,I'm trying to think.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"I don't really have any social engagements planned, or I would say try to behave when I'm out with friends."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,I think I'd try to set the goal of getting under the calorie limit for every day this week.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"And then let's see, for our call next week, so if you want to do the same day and time?"
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"Yeah, that should be fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"Actually, I am not going to be available at the same time, sorry."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"Well, we can push it back to Thursday if that's better."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"The same 1115, if that's okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Yes, Thursday at 1115 is great."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Okay, then I will talk to you then."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"All right, thank you."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6032.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are officially in week four."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Were you able to get to lesson three and four?
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"Okay, and what did you think of those lessons?"
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yeah, I mean, I think that's, you know, pretty straightforward stuff."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I was just kind of remembering because it went through like a couple days ago.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"Lesson three, can you just remind me what the topics were?"
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"Yes, lesson three was called adding activity to your day, and then lesson four was called making smart food choices."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Okay, yeah, so, you know, the adding activity, I mean, you know, I think right now I'm doing pretty well with that."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"It's just things like today, I mean, I can't go work out normally like I normally do during lunchtime because I have to leave early from work and I'm going to be working through lunch, so..."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"things like that, I have to kind of make other arrangements to get my exercise in, and then, like, you know, if things come up like that again, you know, you've got to plan around it."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"And then for, like, you know, making smarter choices, yeah, I've been trying to incorporate more, like, fruits and vegetables, you know, in my meals and that kind of thing, trying to avoid snacks, at least"
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,unhealthy snacks and that kind of stuff so the key will be like a week from this weekend I'm going camping with my son and you know it's basically we get food provided for us which isn't always the best stuff so we'll see what they have but
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"So first, to touch on the physical activity, like you said, you're doing very well."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"Out of the seven days, I saw you did activity all seven days."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"You did 333 minutes, so you did meet that 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,So really great job there.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"And also with the smart food choices, very good job this week as well."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"Last time, you know, we had talked a little bit about some strategies that maybe you could use to kind of..."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,be more mindful since we wanted to kind of see if we could increase the amount of days that you were meeting your calories.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,Definitely looks like you did that.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"I saw you met your goal five, your calorie goal five days and your fat gram goal six of the days."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"So, you know, with that SMART goal, trying to stay under that 1,800 calories, you did very well with that."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"And also you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,So really this past week was great.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"And most recent weight, 220."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"Um, what day is that from?"
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"Today, I believe."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,Oh.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,Whatever your most recently entered weight was.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"Yeah, that seems about right."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"I think it said 221 on the scale, so maybe around down or something."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Yeah, so that's actually a five-pound difference from our last check-in, so a little, you know, more than we would like to see down, but obviously something that you did this past week worked very well."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Was there something in specific that you felt like you did to kind of help you stay within
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"Well, I think the key is, you know, staying under the calories and fat things pretty much every day."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"And then, you know, the exercise, obviously."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"So, like I said, early when I try to lose weight, it usually drops off pretty fast."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"And then it's going to level off at some point and, you know, be like one to two pounds a week."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"So, I think that's just because, you know, I got so much weight to lose."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"Yeah, I mean, exactly."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"You know, your body gets used to something, and then, like you said, it just kind of becomes harder."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"But so far, doing very, very well."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,I wanted to touch a little bit on this camping trip that you're taking.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"So just to kind of reiterate, you said, you know, they're providing food for you, and you're not entirely sure if it's going to be the healthiest choices."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Yeah, I mean, I went camping with my other son last month, and, like, you know, they had –"
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"barbecue pork and some other stuff, you know, so it wasn't always, like, the healthiest thing."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"But, um, I think they always have, like, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich option or something."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"I want to go for that, but that is, you know, a lot of fat grams, too, so I'm not sure how I'm going to manage that."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,So I may bring some of my own food.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Yeah, um..."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"You know, definitely sounds like a barrier and it's going to be something, you know, difficult."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"This is kind of one of those situations that's really like not, you know, it's very out of the ordinary."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"But, you know, in general there are some things that we can suggest."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"You know, while you can also bring your own food, portion sizes are probably going to be very key."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,So it's very likely that they'll have at least something that is moderately healthy.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"So, you know, filling up with your plate on that and then maybe adding some of the other things, but just smaller portions of those is probably really going to be key."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"With weight loss, while it would be great to completely overhaul your diet and always eat healthy food, that's probably just not reasonable in the long run."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"So as long as you stay within your goals, you should be fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"But yeah, we'll definitely see how that goes as that approaches."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"But in terms of everything that's been happening so far, you're doing very well, so just keep up the good work."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"And then, you know, with the camping trip, obviously I'm not going to be able to bring that scale with me."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Right.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"So, you know, I'll be leaving, like, Friday morning and getting home Sunday morning."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,So I might just wait Friday morning and Sunday morning.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,And probably won't be able to weigh on Saturday.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,That's fine.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"You know, one day missed is fine as long as you, you know, weigh on when you can."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,It's okay with us.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"For that next call, just go ahead and read Lesson 5."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"That one is called Navigating Social Queues, Gatherings, and Holidays."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for this week?
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"I think the key would be, you know, that weekend, you know, I go camping not too long."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,That's actually next week.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"I think the main goal is just basically stay on track and not, you know, not"
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"go off the wagon, so to speak."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"Yeah, so, you know, maintaining, sticking to your goals, correct?"
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"All right, and then, let's see, for our call next week, when is a good day and time for you to talk?"
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"Either Wednesday or Thursday, whichever works best for you around the same time."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,Let's go ahead...
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"Sorry, one second."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,I'm just looking at my calendar.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,Sure.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,"Can we do the 27th, so this next Thursday at 1130?"
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,Would that be okay?
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"Yeah, that should be fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"Have a great weekend, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"All right, thank you."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6032.F.w4.7.20.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,So we are officially in week five.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Lesson five was called Navigating Social Queues, Gatherings, and Holidays."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,What did you think of that?
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,I think it would have come in handy if I had read it before this past weekend.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"But I went to a birthday party on Saturday, and..."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,Ended up eating two hot dogs when I probably shouldn't have.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"But I tried to, you know, eat a lot of vegetables and fruit, you know, while I was there instead of gorging on all the other snacks they had."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"So I think it was kind of good and bad, but, yeah."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Practicing some moderation, you know, could have been a lot worse than it was."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"But, you know, do you feel like after that birthday party you were able to kind of get yourself back on track, sticking to your goals?"
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"Yeah, I think so for the most part."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"I think I'm hovering right around the 1,850, maybe a little more here and there, but usually pretty much in line."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"All right, so your SMART goal last week, so we just wanted to kind of stick to your goals, make sure that you were hitting your calorie and fat gram goals, watching what you were eating."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"To go over your data, it looked like a pretty good week."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,So I saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories all seven days.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,You met your calorie goal five of those days and your fat gram goal three of those days.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"So fat grams pretty good, or excuse me, calories pretty good."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"Fat grams again, maybe just needs a little bit of tweaking here and there."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,Do you feel like the foods that you're eating are in particularly like high in fat or kind
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Well, I think, yeah, there were some times when we, you know, went out to eat or whatever and, you know, or ordered food in and, you know, it's like the salad dressing, you know, we'll get you when you have a salad and that kind of thing."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"You don't really realize it until you, you know, look it up."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"So I just have to be a little more careful about, you know, what I'm, you know, using."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,And then...
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"You know, we made some homemade salmon burgers, and I tried to calculate what it was, and I may have overestimated the fat there because, you know, we cook it in oil, but not all the oil goes into the burgers."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"So I'm not sure, you know."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"I think I probably overestimated the fat in that, but, you know, at the same time, I was trying to be, you know..."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"Rather air on the high side than the low side, I think."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"Yes, exactly."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"We always, you know, encourage people to overestimate just a little bit instead of underestimating."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"You know, you don't want to cheat yourself, especially when it comes to something like this."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"But in general, with the fat grams, your budget is 50 grams of fat."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"I see you're at like 53 grams, 57 grams, so nothing, you know, too bad."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,Maybe just a little bit of tweaking.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"Let's see, physical activity, I saw six days recorded last week."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Your goal was 300 minutes, you did 217, so very, very close, maybe just one workout or so shy of that goal."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"And then most recent weight I see is 218, is that correct?"
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Okay, so it looks like you have actually officially met your goal for the study, you know, almost at that halfway point, so still a lot of time."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Have you kind of given thought of how you
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,I want to continue to lose weight because I know I've got more weight to lose.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"And, you know, I'll probably even continue it after the study because my goal is to get down probably to around, you know, 170-ish in that range."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Yeah, so probably not going to hit that."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"No, no, I'm hoping to be right around 200, maybe a little over by the end of this study."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"Yeah, so we'll just keep on going then as we are, sticking to that 1,800 calorie goal and then 50 fat grams."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"But, you know, otherwise, again, doing very well, still losing weight consistently."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"Okay, then for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 6, Ways to Stay Motivated, so you know by the time we talk you'll officially have finished half of the three-month initial intervention."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"So I just kind of want to reassess why you joined, your goals, things like that."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Well, I know, you know, I'm going camping this weekend, so I want to make sure that I stay on track, especially while I'm camping."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"You know, I think we talked a little, like, last week about how, you know, it's basically not very conducive to losing weight because we don't have really a choice as to what food we eat."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"So I just want to make sure I try to, you know,"
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,eat healthy as much as possible.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,Right.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,Of course.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"You know, you can't, it's hard to avoid when you're not even given the choice, but just making sure when those healthy options are available that you're just trying to stay on track."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Our call next week.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"So if we do the same day and time, that's going to be next Thursday at 1130."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Is that okay?
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"Yeah, that should be fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"All right, thank you."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6032.F.w5.7.27.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, we are in week six of the study, so halfway done."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Were you able to get to lesson six, ways to stay motivated?"
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"Okay, and what did you think of that lesson?"
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Well, I mean, I think so far I haven't had any problems being motivated."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"It's just that, yeah, I think"
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"After a certain point in time, you know, things might get a little mundane or whatever, and you may want to try to change things up."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"Yeah, how are you feeling, you know, about your own motivation now that you've kind of been with this program for six weeks and you still have six more to go?"
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"I think, you know, my motivation, you know, wanes a little here and there, but for the most part I'm kind of focused on, you know, losing the weight and that kind of thing."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"And then let's see, your SMART goal."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"So you had gone on that camping trip, so you just wanted to make sure that you kind of didn't slip up too often."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"And when you did, you kind of got back on track trying to stick to the goals."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,So how did that go?
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,Not as good as I would like.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"They didn't really have any alternative, you know, for us."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"in terms of meals, and I didn't bring anything, you know, myself, so I was basically stuck eating their food, and when I added up the calories, I was over my, you know, goals for the day."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"And then when I got home, you know, we went to one of my in-laws' place for, like, a barbecue, and I, you know, went over the calories that day as well, so..."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"I think I got back on track, you know, starting Monday, but the weekend wasn't very good."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"Yeah, well, you know, in that situation, on a camping trip, that is out of your control."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,So don't beat yourself up over that too much.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"Just know that, you know, now that you're back on track, it looks like, you know, you're not doing too bad."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"So looking at your calories, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,And then you met your calorie goal four of those days and your fat gram goal four of those days as well.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,So not too bad considering your limited options while you were away.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Then let's see, physical activity was really great."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Last week I saw all seven days you recorded physical activity and then you did a total of 569 minutes.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,So really blowing past that 300 minute goal.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"Yeah, well it helps that basically all day Saturday we're just walking around all over."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Yeah, so definitely helps."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 214.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Yeah, that's from yesterday."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"I think I'm at like 215 today, so I might have been artificially low yesterday."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,I might have been dehydrated or something.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,I don't know.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Yeah, that happens."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"But, you know, regardless, that's about three to four pounds down from the last time we checked in."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"So even though you had said, you know, you felt like you really went over on your goals and you were, you know, out of your normal routine, still losing weight, a little bit faster than we'd like, but it looks like, you know, you're still making progress."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"So now that you're kind of back into your normal routine, what have you been doing to kind of get back on track?"
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"I've just been trying to limit the junk food kind of stuff and eat more lean meats and trying to get more fruits and vegetables into my diet, that kind of thing."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Yeah, and then I know you had said physical activity this past week was a little abnormal since, like you said, you were walking all day."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Generally, you know, with physical activity, you're pretty good about meeting the goals."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"So do you feel like this week, you know, that's going to be an easy goal for you to achieve as well?"
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"Yeah, I think when I first started the study, I was, you know, we had a new dog, and I was walking her, you know, in the morning and after work, and then I was also doing my usual workout at noon."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,I kind of got away from doing the morning walk because I'm lazy and I like to sleep in.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"And so I think, you know, I might try to get back into doing the morning walk as well."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Great.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Because I think, what, like two weeks ago or a week or so ago, I fell below the 300, and that's probably why."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"All right, awesome."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"Okay, then for, oh, just wanted to check in."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,really quick.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"You know, we are at the halfway point."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,You're at 214 right now.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,So kind of how are you feeling about your progress so far?
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,I think it's going really well.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"I just hope I can, you know, keep it up because, you know, like I said, my goal is to get down to a decent, you know, weight and body fat percent by the end of the year."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"But, you know, by the end of the study, I wouldn't mind losing another 10 to 15 pounds."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"So,"
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"All right, then for that next call, if you could go ahead and just read Lesson 7."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"I think, you know, I'm going to try, you know, at least starting next week to get up and, you know, do the morning walk."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"Okay, yeah."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"But I'm at least walking, like, three different times a day."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"Yeah, great."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"Okay, then let's see."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,For our call next week...
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,So I'm actually not going to be available at 1130.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,Is there another day and time that works for you?
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,About Wednesday at 1130.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Yep, that should be fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"So that's going to be next Wednesday the 9th at 1130, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"All right, then I will check in with you then."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,Have a great week and keep up the good work.
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"All right, thank you."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6032.F.w6.8.3.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week seven."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,We'll be going over our general agenda.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"So first, lesson seven, were you able to get to that one?"
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Unfortunately, no."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"So for our next call, I'm just going to ask you to read lesson seven and eight, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,And then let's see your previous SMART goal.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"I started doing that on Monday, so I've been doing it the last few days."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,And how's that been going?
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,Good.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,I take the dog out for a walk every morning.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Then let's see, looking at your data, it's looking good as always."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"So you record at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,You met your calorie and fat gram goal five of those days.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,Physical activity all seven days recorded as well.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,You did a total of 372 minutes.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,So you did meet that 300-minute goal.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 209.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Okay, so that is five pounds down from the last time we checked in, so a huge drop, a little bit faster than we would like."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Yeah, I'm surprising myself, to be frank."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,I don't expect to be losing this much weight.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"It's not like I'm always hitting that 1,800 calories."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"I think I'm doing more exercise than I've done in the past, and that's probably overcompensating for it or leading to a bigger weight loss."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Yeah, and I was looking at your calorie intake as well."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"You're staying pretty close to your 1,800 calorie goal, so it's not like you're really restricting yourself there either."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,So maybe your body is just kind of losing weight faster than normal.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"But like I said, a little bit faster than we'd like."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"So if that continues, we might bump up your goal a little bit just because it's"
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"For our next call, like I said, please go ahead and read Lessons 7 and 8."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,And then what would you like your smart goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Well, seeing as I'm going to be going to Universal starting Saturday, I'm probably going to want to at least maintain my weight or not gain any weight."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Then for our call next week,"
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,Are you unavailable certain days?
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"I will be back Thursday, so we could set up a call for Friday."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Okay, what time would you like to talk?"
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"Maybe around the usual time, 11 or 11.30."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,Would 11 be okay?
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,Then I'll put you down for that day and time.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Enjoy your vacation, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"All right, thanks."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6032.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,We are in week nine.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,How was your trip?
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,Good.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Probably ate too much, but it was good."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"No, looking at your data, everything seems just fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,So I'm glad that you enjoyed it.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,Are you back now?
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Yeah, yeah, we're back."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,But like.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,See you next weekend.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,We're going camping again.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"And then two weeks after that, I go camping again."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,So a lot of camping this summer.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"Yeah, well, at least you know you've done it once, so you kind of know how to approach it this time."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"Let's see, for this call, you were asked to read Lesson 9, Stress Management."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"Unfortunately, no."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,I'm just going to ask you to read 2 then for our next call.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"Yeah, that's fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"All right, let's see then."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"Your SMART goal, you had said coming back, you just wanted to get back on track, you know, controlling your meals at home."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,So how's that been going?
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Well, it started off okay, but last night, you know, we were celebrating my wife's birthday."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"We had Mexican food, and I probably way overdid it, so..."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Yeah, well, you know, those special occasions do happen."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"You know, it's definitely okay to, you know, participate in the social event, things like that."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"But just knowing, you know, today's a new day, you can kind of get yourself back on track."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Do you feel like, you know, you kind of have control of that, being able to, you know, control the foods that you're taking and things like that?"
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"I mean, you know, during my normal work days and stuff, I think I'm a little better at, you know, managing food intake and stuff like that."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"Like you said, when special occasions or, you know, I'm kind of out of town or whatever, things kind of can get off track."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Well, let's see."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Let's go ahead and go over your data then.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"So since the last time you'd connected with someone, it's been six days."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,quarter at least a thousand calories all six days it looks like you met your calorie goal three of those days and your fat gram goal two of those days so uh definitely a little uh lower than usual generally you're a little bit better about hitting those goals so um looking at the data it's not too bad though when you're over with the calories it's maybe about a thousand or so calorie or not thousand excuse me a hundred or so calories over um it's the
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,more attention to um seems like those are getting a little bit high so just remember you know making those food choices um always substituting in more vegetables and fruits things like that right um let's see physical activity so if i remember um
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"You had switched up the Fitbit, so it looks like the activity is coming in fine for this week."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"Last week, though, since you had run out of batteries, I only see two days entered, a total of 84 minutes."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,But do you feel like last week you did more physical activity?
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"Yeah, that was when I was on my trip, and I think, you know, the Fitbit I had at that time, between sweat and a couple water rides, the battery corroded."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"Um, so I think you had like Sunday and Monday, but not Tuesday and Wednesday or something like that."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"Yeah, I would say for Tuesday and Wednesday, they would be probably the equivalent of Sunday and Monday because we were just walking around the park all that time."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"And then Thursday, I think, was a travel day, so we were pretty much on the plane most of the day and maybe a little walking in the airport."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,So I wouldn't say there was a lot of physical activity that day.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"And Friday, I think, was the last day before I figured out a way to..."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,get my other Fitbit next to it.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"And that, I think, was kind of a light day as well."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Yeah, no problem."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"So, like I said, physical activity is coming in fine now, so no big deal."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,I'll make a note of that.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"But most recently, I see 209."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"Yeah, so I did see a little bit of a bump last week when you had checked in."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"You were at 211, so now you're down two pounds again."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"209, so that's where we left off before you."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"So it looks like, you know, like I said, it wasn't too bad or anything like that."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"Just, you know, continuing to monitor what you're eating and, like I said, being a little bit more vigilant with those fat grams, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"Then for our next call, like I said, two lessons, 9 and 10."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be?
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"Yeah, I think I want to go, you know, with, like, you know, incorporating more fruits and vegetables and trying to keep the fat grams, you know, under 50%."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,Let's see here.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"For our call next week, does this day and time still work, the 31st?"
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"Thursday, yeah, 1130 should be fine."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"All right, thanks."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6032.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are officially in week one of the study."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, OK?"
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,OK.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"OK, so the first thing, well, I'll tell you a little bit about how these calls are going to work."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,So we'll be going over the lesson.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"Then we'll be going over all of your data, so all your nutrition goals, so calories and fat grams, physical activity, most recent weight,"
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,"We'll talk about any barriers or progress you've made, and then we'll be setting your first smart card."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"Okay, so first off, were you able to get to Lesson 1?"
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,It took me a while to figure out where I had saved the username and password.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,I was trying to use my... Sorry about that.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,But I figured it out.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"No, it was me."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,I just put it in the wrong place.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,And then what did you think of that first lesson?
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"I mean, it was pretty basic."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"I think, you know, there wasn't anything surprising, but there was nothing alarming or that I disagreed with either."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Good to hear.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,So then we'll go ahead and go over your data.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"So, so far I see everything is coming through."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,Good.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"And just to remind you, your calorie goal is 1,800 calories."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,Your fat goal is 50 fat grams.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"So if you remember, I had said we consider a full day of recording anything where you've recorded at least 1,000 calories and over."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"So looking at the past two days, so the 26th and 27th, since your intervention just started on Monday, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories both of those days, so really great job there."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,And then it does look like you met your calorie goal both of those days.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Didn't quite hit your fat gram either of those days, though."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,that um i think that was based on me trying to leave out things that i might normally eat that i know are more fattening and steer more towards um healthier choices okay um so do you feel like um you know seeing how many fat grams um you're eating now you kind of have an idea of where you need to adjust or was it surprising to you yeah i mean there's definitely things that i would
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"like to eat or would think about eating normally or that I'm trying to at least control the portions on and if I can have an omelet without cheese or if I have the low cheese alternative to that or can I have, you know, whole grains more than some of my fattier choices."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Can I have a salad that's
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"um, got less dressing on it if I steered towards something with a little more, um, of a vinaigrette instead of a creamy dressing."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"So yeah, already, you know, recognizing some areas where you can make some switches, which is great."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Um, you know, I will say just based on past experience, you know, the fat grams are always very surprising for people since that's not something that they normally track."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Um, but you know, it's good that, um,"
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"You know, you recognize that right away early on in the study so that you can make adjustments now that will help down the line."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,And let's see.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Looking at physical activity, so your goal right now is 60 minutes per week."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,I see 35 minutes entered on Monday.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,Does that sound correct?
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,It does.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,And I will say I left my Fitbit charger.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,In Michigan.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"So my Fitbit is really low, but I'm getting a new one today."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,So it may be a little off today.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"But yesterday was my computer day, so I didn't get much exercise."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,And I know that there's always going to be one day like that a week.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"Yeah, no problem."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"You know, you're already more than halfway to that goal."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"So, you know, as long as, you know, by Sunday you try to hit that 60 minutes, you know, it's totally okay how you space those out."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,And last week I went so over it without even trying.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,And then let's see.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 217.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,I thought it was 218.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,I see 217.58 entered.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"Today, okay."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"So, yeah, already significantly down from that Monday weight."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,So it already kind of looks like that you are losing weight pretty steadily.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"Actually, I see a six-pound difference."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"Well, I will say I don't know how much this affects things, but it was that time of the month, so I'm always more bloated and heavier."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,So I feel like part of that's just water weight that goes away every time that goes away.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"Yeah, thanks."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Yeah, yeah."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"But, yeah, I see on Monday you were 223 and today you're 217."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"So that's a pretty significant, you know, three-day."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,Exactly.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"But I did the same thing last week, so that's weird."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"Oh, sorry, go ahead."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"I do know, so like I said, I go to Michigan on a weekend."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,And what I did was just bring the scale with me.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,and enter it manually instead of trying to rethink it.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,"Yeah, yeah, that's totally fine."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"You know, as long as we have some number, you know, that's totally okay."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"So, you know, like I said on our tech call, not that much to look at right now since we don't have a full week of data just yet."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,But is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or anything that you wanted to talk about?
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"No, I mean, I mentioned it before, and it really is,"
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"a challenge to use the app to record everything just because of, even if the average all brands were all at the top, but searching through for every type of normal thing, I mean searching through for tomatoes should not take as long as it does."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,So improvements on the app would be helpful.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,What I'm doing a lot is going to Fitbit
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,And looking up the weight there and then going over and setting it up as a custom weight based on what Fitbit showed.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,It's easier to search and find it rather than assuming that what I ate.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"If I'd eaten that thing at a certain restaurant, it's going to be what it would be if I make it myself."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,"You know, like I said during that randomization session, we don't want this to be, you know, a cumbersome process."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,I get it.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"So I'm just worried that, you know, looking in Fitbit and then going back to our app, you know, that's going to be very annoying for you."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,For sure.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,What I'm doing is when it's something that I think I'll be eating more often.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,You know what I mean?
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"And then in general, you know, just we know it's not going to be exact."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,It's not going to be 100% perfect.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"Just trying to find something similar is fine as well, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"All right, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,"Then for our next call, if you could go ahead, read Lesson 2."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,That one is called Healthy Eating.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,"So this one is kind of just a follow-up to that first lesson, just some tips on how to eat better, make better."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,"smarter food choices, things like that."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,And then we can go ahead and set your first SMART goal.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,So have you heard of SMART goals before?
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"Yes, I've used them in work."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,So did you kind of have an idea of what you'd like your SMART goal to be for this week until our next call?
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,I really hadn't thought about it.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,Are there examples of what others have used?
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,"Yeah, so, you know, like I said, we don't have much data so far, so we can't really see where you might want to improve or things like that, but in general, you know, people might make goals like they want to walk at least 15 minutes every day or, you know, they want to get at least two servings of vegetables every day or something like that, just"
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,"You know, this is supposed to just be a space where you feel like, you know, you can accomplish something."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,"It'll help motivate you towards your larger goal, things like that."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,I think what might be a good goal is to try and get a vegetable serving at least two meals a day.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,128,patient,Because I don't necessarily always reach for the vegetables.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,"Okay, yeah, and it's the perfect time."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,"You know, there's a lot of fresh fruits and veggies available."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,"Yes, yes."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,132,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,134,advisor,"Okay, and then our call for next week."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,135,advisor,So did you want to do the same day and time?
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,Is that going to work out?
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,That would work for me if it works for you.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,"Yeah, no problem."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,"So that's going to be next week, July 5th at 10 a.m., okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,140,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,141,patient,"All right, sure."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,142,patient,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,143,patient,"Keep up the great work, all right?"
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,144,patient,"All right, thanks."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,145,patient,"Okay, bye-bye."
Margaret/6038.F.w1.6.28.17.MD.MP3,146,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Alright, so we are in week 11."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,1,patient,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,So how have you been doing?
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,I've been good.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"I have a little cold, so that's been there, but I'm doing good."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,How have you been feeling about the study and the goals?
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I think I've been trying to get back into it.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"Last week with all the stress, my mom just kind of"
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,I wasn't at home.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,I wasn't able to focus on that at all.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,So I started to really try and pay attention again this weekend and trying to get more physical activity back in.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"The cold kind of set me off, though."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,Have you been keeping up with the lessons at Albany?
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,I have.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"Well, I got caught up with them."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"So the last one, so lesson 11 was balance your thoughts."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,What did you think about that lesson?
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"I think, well, it kind of went along with the mindfulness lesson the week before, which I kind of did both of those at the same time, just in trying to –"
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,I think the mindfulness really hit home more so than the balance your thoughts just because I think it's something I need to focus on.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,I do tend to just eat mindlessly sometimes or eat like I feel like eating instead of really concentrating on it.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Sorry, I'm just losing my place here."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,And it kind of goes hand in hand with the...
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,balancing your thoughts and trying to keep the negative thoughts out or not letting negativity influence how you're eating.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"Um, let's see here then."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"So looking at your data over the past week, so I'm looking at from the last Wednesday, August 30th until yesterday, the 5th, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories, five of those days, it looks like you met your calorie goal, four of those days, and your background goal, five of those days."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"Physical activity, I saw five days recorded, you did 206 minutes, so not quite at that"
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,No.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"A lot of last week I was sitting with my mom or driving her places, that kind of thing."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,And then your goal this week is 296 minutes.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"With the cold, do you feel like that's attainable?"
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"Yeah, I think so."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,I think I'm nipping it in the bud now.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 206.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,bad here.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,I kind of want to finish off strong since our last call is going to be our last one for this initial part of the intervention.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"So kind of these last two or so weeks, what are you thinking of doing to kind of finish off on a high note?"
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Yeah, well, I think the goal I was thinking about was around the mindfulness, really trying to keep a log."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,I started this morning a log of
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"kind of how hungry I am before I eat, following the steps that are laid out in that lesson to try and track why I'm eating, how much I'm eating, and really take time to think about eating."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"It's not really thinking about eating, but taking your time with eating as opposed to just shoveling it in."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"I think that would be helpful, so I'd like to try and keep a log about that for a week."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,Did you want to make that your SMART goal?
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Great, yeah, that's really interesting."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,And then I did want to let you know you are one pound away from your weight loss goal.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,I had met it and kind of put it back on.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Right, which is fine."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Like I said, we still have about two weeks or so."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Yeah, I think I can make it."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,Is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or anything that you wanted to talk about?
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,I don't think so.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"And our last lesson, number 12, that one is called Weight Loss Plateau."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Then we have your SMART goal down.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Let's see here.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"Next Wednesday is going to be the 13th, and then that's going to be at 10."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Sounds good.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"Then I will check in with you then, Sharon."
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"Take care of yourself, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6038.F.w11.9.6.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,Sorry about that.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,It's okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"So, yeah, we are in week 12."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,This will be our last call.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,We did agree to be audio recorded.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,So we'll be talking about a few different things today.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"So, of course, you know, our normal agenda, the lesson, and all your data."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"But just kind of want to wrap up, you know, talk about a little bit what you should expect after this three-month assessment and things like that, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"So lesson 12, weight loss plateau."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,Did you get to that one?
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,I did.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,And what did you think of that lesson?
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,It's pretty true.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"I mean, I think after a certain amount of weeks of doing something, you just start doing it kind of half-heartedly or you resent it or something like that."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,So I probably have reached a point.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"I think with me, I go in fits and spurts where I'm really good and then I kind of ease off and then I'm good."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"I don't think I've ever really had a, oh, I've just thrown it all out the window and"
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"forgotten everything type of period, but definitely times where I just am not as active or, you know, as aggressive as I am on other days, so."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Yeah, definitely."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"For your SMART goal, so you had talked about wanting to keep that log of how hungry you were."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,Things like that.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,I didn't...
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,Didn't do such a great job on that.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"I was sick last week, so I wasn't really eating."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"I was eating broths and soups and stuff, so I don't know if that was the best week to be doing the mindfulness of it, because you just kind of flip those as opposed to, I think that's something I'd like to try doing when I'm eating real food."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,so looking at your data there were definitely a few empty days and generally you know your calories were pretty low so that definitely explains it but I saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories four of the days you met your calorie background goal all four of those days physical activity four days as well you did 261 minutes so not quite at your goal right let's see your goal this week is 290 do you feel like that's feasible yeah
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,And then let's see.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 207.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Is that correct?
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Uh-huh.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"That was this morning, yeah."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Yeah, so that's a few pounds down from the last time we checked in."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,And kind of back to where we were before we had kind of dropped off a little bit.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,So are you feeling better now?
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,Hopefully I can maintain that.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"I am, and I'm eating real food again."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"So, like, it was just even the cooking –"
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"the vegetables or it wasn't, I just, nothing sounded good or felt good."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"So, uh, I've been eating real food again this week."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,But really trying to focus on the vegetables.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Um, glad to hear that you're feeling better."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"Um, and I just want to take some time to talk about, um,"
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,kind of the next few months.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,So do you kind of remember what's going to happen after that three-month assessment?
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,That I can keep using the app if I want.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"I have access to it, right?"
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,Correct.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,And I know I have another assessment.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"So I thought it was at three months, at six months, and at 12 months?"
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"Yes, correct."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"So really, you know, I guess this is a good time to kind of think about, you know, during your time in these first"
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"three months, kind of what was working and what wasn't."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"You know, of course, since you won't be talking to me, it will be quite different."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"But really, even though we aren't checking in every week, you can still kind of do the same things, you know, look at your progress week by week."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,You can even set SMART goals for yourself if you find that that's helpful.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"And then we do want to let you know that although you have to return both the scale and the Fitbit zip, if you do decide to buy your own Fitbit, you can sync it to the app."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,And I don't have your Fitbit.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,I have my own.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"Ah, correct."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,I'll just return the scale.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"But, of course, if you ever have any questions or there are problems with the app, you can, of course, contact the study, and we'll try to fix anything."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"I mean, I think I'd like to try and use just a Fitbit meal tracker as opposed to – I just found the meal tracker challenging to use."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,I think I've mentioned that to you.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"So I'd like to try, but I wasn't about to try and do both."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,I might just try using the Fitbit one because it does seem a little more intuitive or easier to find certain foods.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,So try that.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,And I think tracking food is very helpful and having to do all of that.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"I think part of what makes me do it, though, is knowing someone's going to be looking at that."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,So I'm not sure how well I'll do on my own.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"And I think probably that's something that's good for me five days out of the week, and then one day it's more a matter of just thinking through what I'm eating but not recording every single morsel that goes into my mouth if I'm at some, you know, somewhere where there's food around."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,So I think I've learned that I like using the app anyway.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,overall you know I just wanted to say you've done very well in the study you know you did surpass your goal and I know you said you are still interested in losing more weight but based on how you've been performing so far I'm sure you will be able to do so I know it's not the easiest thing in the world but all it takes is a little bit of perseverance yeah okay so of course there are no more lessons for us to read however if you do ever want to
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"take a look at any of those, you will still have access to the website."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,You can always read those.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,Do you want to set one last SMART goal for yourself?
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"Yeah, I've been thinking all weekend what it should be."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,I think it's just more making sure that I get physical activity every day.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,So kind of setting that for the rest of this week.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,And then are we having another call next Wednesday or are we done?
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,The last call.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,That's what I thought.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,So that'll be my own personal goal.
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,"Again, you've done very well in the study."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"It has been an absolute pleasure talking to you, and I wish you all the best in the future, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,"Thank you, Margaret."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"All right, then we will see you at your three-month assessment."
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,"Good luck with everything, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w12.9.13.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"Okay, thank you."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,So let's go ahead and get started.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,So we are officially in week two of the study.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"Thank you, yes."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,So I asked you to read lesson two.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,That was healthy eating.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,What did you think of that one?
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"I mean, a lot of it is yes, I already know that, but it was a good reminder."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,And a good way to think about ways to tweak my diet.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,So do you want to tell me a little more about that?
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"You know, now that you're in week two, have you noticed some areas that you feel like you want to work on, things like that?"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,I have.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,I don't.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"So last week, holiday week, house full of people, it was really hard to do things that I know are more permanent day-to-day changes because there was just food everywhere, there's"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"you know, events and going out and all of that."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"It was, I know that's not a normal week, so I can't really use it as an example."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"But even there, I could see ways where I made sure that when I was at the party, I wasn't anywhere near the appetizer table."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"And, um, I ate healthy before I went to the party and just really cut down on what it was."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"So if I am going to indulge, do it responsibly."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"Yeah, that's great."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"You know, um,"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"you know, so early on in the study, it definitely sounds like you have already built up a lot of skills or, you know, you've already had these in mind."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,I'm not saying I was successful the whole time.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"At least I saw when I was making bad choices and went, okay, well, I'm going to do that."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"And, you know, also, you know, those holidays don't come around very often."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"So, you know, even, like you said, if you want to have a little bit indulging responsibly, things like that, those are always great to keep in mind."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"And then I also tried to increase the physical activity to kind of,"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,Go along with that.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"So, all right, but I need to fit in an extra walk today."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"Or, okay, they're going kayaking."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,Go with them.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Go do this with the kids.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"If you want to treat them to Dairy Queen, you should play volleyball with them for an hour first."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,And then let's see.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Your previous SMART goal, so you had said you wanted to try to get in at least one serene of vegetables twice a day."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,So how did that go?
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Yeah, and actually I think I was hitting about two servings a day, maybe not on the Sunday that was kind of a party day."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"But things like grilling some tomatoes to go along with an egg in the morning instead of just having carbs and sweets, having an omelet with some healthy food in it."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"I had a smoothie, and I put spinach into the smoothie to increase getting kind of an intake of that type of –"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"Fruits is easy, but almost too easy where I'm afraid that I'm just going to increase the sugar so much."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,But there are easy ways to do it.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,I just need to have the food available in order to do it.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"Okay, yeah."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,Are you the one that usually goes grocery shopping in your house?
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,At home.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Again, I was at Summer Cottage this week."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,But I come up here and it's easy to pick up fresh fruit from the fruit stands up here and bring it home.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"So, yeah, already, like I said, sounds like a lot of good methods you're trying to employ."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"And it's great, you know, so early on in the study that you're really trying to cement those."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,And it'll become a lot easier as the weeks go on.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,We will go ahead and go over your data now.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,So I am looking at June 26th to July 2nd.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"So basically last week, it looks like you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days that week."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,And then you met your calorie goal five of those days and your fat gram goal four of those days.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,So doing very well so far.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"You know, even on the days where you didn't quite hit those, the 800-calorie budget or the 50-fat gram budget, you were still very, very close."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,I will say there's probably some nibbling of fat grams.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"It's just hard when you walk past a table and you have one chip or one, you know,"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"I'm going to say there's some things I missed this week, but again, I decided just to get what I could get done and not kick myself for forgetting to add one thing if I missed it."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"Yeah, and just based on the recording, it looks like generally most days you have a little bit of wiggle room there."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"Usually you're around 45 fat grams or so, so even that one little bite really won't put you over too much."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,Physical activity was really great as well.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,Five days recorded total.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,I see...
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,You recorded a total of 258 minutes.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,Does that sound pretty accurate?
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"It does, it does."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"And it might not count some time in the water, swimming, that kind of thing, where I took it off."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"But unless I went for a swim or went for a kayak ride, I didn't record it separately."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"Okay, yeah, so really great."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"Really surpassed that 60-minute physical activity goal, so that's awesome."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"I will let you know, and then..."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Tell me if you see this in the app because you might or you might not.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Your physical activity goal for this week has bumped up to 300 minutes.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Is that true?
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,I thought I noticed a difference.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"Yes, it is."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,And that's fine.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,"I will say, so, again, I'm at the summer cottage."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,There's stuff going on.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,It's easier to get in just basic physical activity versus going
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"When I'm at home and I'm trying to work and then having to remind, so it'll be a little tougher next, you know, if I go into next week."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,But that's good.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,I need that stretch going.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,"Okay, wonderful."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 218.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"You know, it was 220 this morning, and I meant to manually enter it."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,It was 220.2.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,I'll get that entered today.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,That's a few pounds up from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,"Despite meeting the goals pretty frequently, do you kind of have an idea of why we're seeing that bump?"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,"It's just the eating and the drinking, which won't go on most weeks."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,"So then, yeah."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,I'm sure part of it's the alcohol.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,The rest of the summer I will probably have as much beer as I did this week.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"Yeah, the holidays, you know, there's always a little bit of beer."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,"In general, like I said, you're doing very well."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"Just trying to maintain that consistency now will really be helpful, and we'll definitely see that weight loss, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,"Then our next lesson, just moving along, is going to be number three."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,That one is called adding activity to your day.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,"So it doesn't sound like you're having too much of a problem getting in that physical activity, but this one just provides it."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,"Again, it might give me ideas on how to make sure I keep doing it when I'm back in my regular routine."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for this week?
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"I want to keep doing the vegetables, but a new one, probably something around physical activity, just making sure maybe getting at least a 10-minute block in three times a day as opposed to doing it all in the evening or doing it all in the morning."
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,121,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,"And then for our call next week, is it okay if we do the same day and time?"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,That would be next Wednesday at 10?
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,Sounds good.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,"Keep up the good work, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w2.7.5.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,We are in week three of the study.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, like always, going over that lesson, your SMART goal, all your data."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"That lesson was number three, adding activity to your day."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,And what did you think of that lesson?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Again, a lot of it is – it's not –"
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,It's stuff that I know or I'm aware of.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"It's just how to, thinking about better how to apply it and how to use it, how to increase physical activity kind of on a regular basis as opposed to doing a lot at once and then not doing anything."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"So do you, right now are you finding that, you know, you're just doing a lot of physical activity like on one day and it's not really, can you tell me a little more about that?"
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"Yeah, I mean, I think what I really need to do is find a way to get it into regular intervals, especially when I'm home."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"I don't belong to a gym, so, like, it's raining right now, so I didn't go for my morning run or walk."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,Where do I go to?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,How do I find different ways to make sure that I'm getting regular activity all the time and get on some sort of a schedule?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"Yeah, so one thing that I've found with other participants who talk about wanting to make physical activity a regular part of your life is just that part of it is actually recognizing that things are going to happen and you may not be able to get in physical activity that one day."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"That just might be the situation, but realizing just missing that one time doesn't mean that"
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"or something else, or the day after."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"You know, yes, for this study we have a specific physical activity goal, but again, things are going to happen, and you just need to learn how to work around that."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"You know, weather, of course, is a huge barrier, especially in the winter."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"As it gets colder, it gets a lot harder for people to go outside."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,Some other participants I know have mentioned looking up videos on YouTube that helps them
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,exercise?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,Have you tried doing that?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Yeah, I'm on the third floor, so there's some videos that work and some I'm not going to do an aerobic class and, you know, close out my neighbor."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,But it works for yoga.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,I found that I do do that.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,But I'm better if I'm somewhere where
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,I do think being in a gym environment is better for me.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"I tend to keep pushing myself if there's other people around, whereas if it's just me and my television, I may do half of it and kind of quit."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Then have you thought about joining a gym?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"I was in a gym, and then I left my job, and so I quit that gym because it was close to my office."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,So I thought at the end of the summer I'll probably look into it again.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"And then maybe we can talk about, you know, if the weather, you know, doesn't let up today, then of course tomorrow is a new day."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,You can also get into selectivity tomorrow.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,Have you thought about what you might want to do then?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"Yeah, a bike ride or a run is typically what I like to do."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"But like today, just making sure that I do do a yoga class or something if it doesn't let up."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,exactly yeah so you know as long as you have that plan and you kind of make a commitment to yourself and you know try to stick to that commitment you know that's most beneficial also you know just looking at your data you've been doing very well with meeting the physical activity goal I think you know to already be at the maximum amount of minutes only in week three is something that you should be really proud of yourself for so don't be too hard on yourself okay yeah I will say it was easier because I was
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"still at the summer home last weekend, and there was just a lot of physical activity around."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"It was easy to participate, whereas it's harder when I'm online."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,I'm kind of working from home right now to get up and go down three flights of stairs.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,I just don't walk around as much.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,I don't get the regular activity I have to make myself go and do it.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,So it's a little more of a challenge in kind of real life.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"of talk about that as the weeks go on since not being at your summer home is kind of your more typical schedule, so we'll see how that plays out."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Yeah, it will certainly be the rest of the summer more typical."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Yes, okay."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"Let's see then, your previous SMART goal, so you said you wanted to do like a 10-minute block of physical activity three times a day."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Were you able to do that?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"I was good at that up until probably Monday of the... For most of last week, I was good at that."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"Today and... Well, Monday and yesterday..."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Again, I'm sitting in my apartment."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"I have to get up and leave the apartment, walk down three flights of stairs, which isn't that big of a deal, but it's just a barrier that I don't do as much."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"Whereas when it was just walk out the door and walk around or get in a kayak and go for a ride or do something that was all right at my fingertips, it was easier."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,And then let's go ahead and go over your data then.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"So just to remind you, your calorie goal is 1,800 calories."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,Your fat gram goal is 50 fat grams.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"So I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days last week."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"Yeah, there were a couple days I went over."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,A couple days I went over.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"Yes, it looks like you met your calorie goal."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,Four of those days didn't quite hit your fat gram.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,goal any of those days so let's talk a little bit about food choices kind of how are you finding that now that you're trying to pay more attention to your calorie and fat gram budget it's tough there's a lot especially like I said at the cottage where there was a lot of food around a lot of not necessarily healthy food there was healthy choices but there was also bags of potato chips open and just food out that I could easily just take a bite of and that was harder
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"So I tried, I went grocery shopping this week and I tried to make more conscious choices about what would be available so that I would have healthier snacks."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"And I tried Monday when I got home, cutting up a bunch of fruit, having that available, cutting up some cucumbers so that I would snack on those instead of the unhealthier choices that I was having around."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"Plus there were a couple of dinners out and you just kind of,"
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,have trouble at a dinner out staying within the fat gram and the calorie range.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Yeah, I can definitely understand, especially like you said, you were in a totally different situation."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"I'm sure there were some social occasions as well, so I can understand why it was difficult to make those decisions."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,But I'm glad to hear that you've already decided to try to
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"make some changes this week, so going grocery shopping, which is great, and it sounds like you meal prepped a little bit, which is great as well."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"In general, though, outside of that, have you found it difficult while you're tracking to stick to the goals?"
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Can you tell me a little bit of how you're tracking?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"Are you doing it after you eat, before you eat?"
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,I'm trying to do it like twice a day.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"not necessarily as I'm eating, but making sure that I do it maybe after lunch and then before I go to bed at night."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"Yeah, so like I said, you know, you're not doing too bad meeting the goals right now, so that's fine."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"I would maybe suggest if you find that you're still having difficulty meeting the goals that you might want to try to, like, pre-record a little bit so that you at least have an idea of where you're at throughout the day."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"Right, that's a good idea."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"Instead of just, you know,"
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,"Uh-huh, planning out the meal and things."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,And then I'd be less tempted to pick up that snack that might put me over kind of thing.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"Exactly, yes."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,It's a good idea.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,"Okay, and then physical activity, like I said, was great."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,"I saw six days where you recorded a total of 305 minutes, so you did meet that 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"Good, I'm glad that came through."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,"Sunday, I got a lot of exercise, and then..."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,I had been in Michigan.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,I came home.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,There's an hour change.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"My clock synced, and I lost, like, 50 minutes of exercise that I had just done."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,"Like, I was at, I don't know, 273, and then all of a sudden I was back down again."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,So it was kind of weird.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,"I ended up going in and just kind of manually entering those, but it was just odd."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,"I was like, oh, because, you know, it was 10 o'clock, and then suddenly it was 9 o'clock, and all those minutes were gone."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,"And it does look like you met your goal, but we'll just make sure."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,That's great.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,"I'm just, I'm curious if I should, I think there's a way to set your clock so that it doesn't switch."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,"And I thought I had done that, but it's, I don't know."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,I'll go back and revisit that because I will be going back to that time zone on different weekends.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,"Not every weekend, but."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,"And then, like I said, I'll make sure it's not something on our end."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"No, it's just."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,"Technical stuff, you know, life is only so easy."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 219.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,121,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,So that looks like we're a pound down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,So good to see that we're seeing that progress.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,"So definitely I'm hearing a lot of great things, a lot of good changes."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,"Still some areas, you know, that we need to work on, but it sounds like you have a plan for that."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,Is there anything else that you would like to discuss on this call?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,Nothing I can think of right now.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,"And for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 4."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,That one is called Making Smart Food Choices.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,132,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,"I don't know if it's too repetitive, but I'd kind of like to do the same thing, trying to get 10 minutes in three times a day, just because it was easy to do while I was on vacation, but I'm finding it harder at home."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,137,advisor,"And then, let's see, for our call next week, would it be okay if we pushed our call to 1030?"
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,138,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,140,advisor,"Yeah, it'll just be for that week."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,141,advisor,"I just have one conflict that came up, so thank you for flexibility."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,142,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,143,patient,"Yeah, that's no problem."
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,146,patient,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,147,patient,You too.
Margaret/6038.F.w3.7.12.17.MD.MP3,148,patient,Thanks.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,So we are in week four.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Before we get into our regular agenda, did you happen to get my email by any chance?"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,Did you not get a response from me?
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I did not.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,I'm sorry.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Sometimes when I email back from my phone, it doesn't go through."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,It was number 30.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"All right, so lesson four, making smart food choices."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,What did you think of that one?
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,It was good.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,Probably a lot of it was stuff that I'm trying to remember because I looked at four and five.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"So I may have combined them, but stuff about what to eat when going out and making smarter food choices like planning the menu ahead of time, I think those are things that I need to work on."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"I tend to be, oh, what do I feel like doing?"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,Or I'd buy food and then I don't feel like cooking it.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,So I need to get more in the habit of figuring out what I will actually make and then setting those menus for the week or at least for a few days of the week.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"I did start, like two weeks ago, I had started, like, cooking on Sunday and trying to lay out some menus for the rest of the week."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,But last week I was sick.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,I was just plain sick.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,So I didn't eat much.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"I ate irregularly, and I did not exercise much."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,So it's a bit of an anomaly.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"But when I'm not sick, I need to be more consistent about –"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"planning something and then sticking to it, actually making what I planned to make."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"And, you know, meal planning like that, we find it to be most helpful for people, especially like when they're"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Yeah, yeah."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,I think I've seen a change in my behavior with that already.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,I've been consciously trying to do that.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Although I realize that I need some, not necessarily unhealthy snacks, but"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,Snacks that fill that unhealthy snack void.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,So like I had some dark chocolate covered almonds that were healthier than other sweets.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"So trying to, when I do have that sweet craving or salt craving, having something there that fits that bill."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,Sometimes cucumbers just don't do it.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"You know, we definitely tell people, you know, don't try to deprive yourself too much."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"We want to find some healthy balance that you'll be able to maintain, you know, for forever, I guess."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"So if you, yeah, I think, you know, finding those not entirely healthy, but, you know, definitely healthier snacks like that."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"Dark chocolate covered almonds, that's definitely helpful."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,As long as I don't eat the whole bag.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Okay, so looking at your SMART goal, you had said you wanted to do at least 10 minutes of physical activity three times a week, so... I did not do that last week."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"There were two days I barely got out of bed, so... Yeah."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"Did you just have, like, a flu, or...?"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"I had a viral... My glands were all swollen, so basically everything was just sore and uncomfortable, and I had a fever for about three days, so..."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,And then I get a medication.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"I feel better now, but even now with the medicine, I have a different taste for food."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,But at least I have energy and I have an appetite again.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"All right, then looking at your data, let's see."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories five days last week."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,It looks like you met your calorie goal three of those days and your fat gram goal one of the days.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"So fat grams, maybe we need to pay a little more attention to."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"eat a lot of, like, fat-rich foods?"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"Probably, yeah."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"And the thing is, I think I'm choosing lower-fat-rich foods than I could be, but it's still, there seems to be fat in, you know, anything with proteins or, what I need to do is do more of, like, grilling chicken or having those kinds of healthier proteins around so that I don't combine them with big"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"Some of it's just coming from avocados or things that are, you know, that are healthier fats, I should say."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"Yeah, and of course, you know, there are healthy fats and then, you know, those other unhealthier fats."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"But weight loss, your body is not going to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy fats."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,That's just kind of for heart health.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,in general you know it's nothing too outrageous you know the highest day you're at was maybe like 50 grams of fat and your goal is 42 so really that's not and I think that was a two eating out two times that day kind of thing so and that I did start to look at next week's I know that gets into a little bit about like ordering out or at occasions that kind of thing I have been trying to
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"Like we went out for a big dinner, trying to find the fish that wasn't, instead of getting the big pasta dish or a burger or something, trying to find a fish that's cooked healthier, not in a heavy sauce."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"But usually they come with things, and I just need to be looking at restaurants I can go to that have healthier options to begin with."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,out is definitely very difficult.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"You know, in those situations, we just ask people to try their best."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"You know, of course, you already, you know, mentioned it to me with keeping some keywords in mind, like grilled, staying away from like sauteed or buttered, things like that."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"Really, you know, there's only so much you can do in those situations."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"So, you know, generally we say, you know, try not to eat out too often."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"But, you know, also when you do eat out, of course, enjoy yourself, but don't go too far."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"Let's see, physical activity, I saw a total of 100 minutes last week."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"Yeah, it was, like I said, not a lot of activity last week."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"Yeah, no problem."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"Just to let you know, your physical activity goal right now is 231 minutes."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"I saw that it dropped, yeah."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"Yes, okay."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"And I'm already, I mean, yesterday and today I've been getting activity again, so we'll see where that goes."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,"So last week, you know, even though you said you were sick, even getting into those three days of physical activity, you know, still not bad."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"Right, right."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,Good to see that.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 216.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,It was 214 yesterday.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"So, you know, a little bit of fluctuation that could be due to a bunch of things, you know, water retention, salt intake, things like that."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,Is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this car that you wanted to talk about?
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"No, I think I'm just, like I said, being sick kind of threw me, so trying to get back into getting up early and moving as opposed to delaying and then just not getting any activity in."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"Yeah, you know, I wouldn't feel too discouraged."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"When we checked in last week, your weight was 219, and if you're 216,"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,despite all the barriers so you know just keep doing what you're doing and like I said just paying a little more attention to the fat grams okay yeah okay alright then for our next call if you could go ahead and read well you said you already looked at it but we'll be going over lesson five on that next call yeah yeah I'll go over it again I think it helps to go over it closer to the call because I've been doing it like right after the like going out today and reading it and then trying to remember it next week when I talk to you so it's better to do it
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,the day before and kind of have that in mind.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be?
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,I meant to think about this.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,Probably around meal planning.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,Maybe setting up a goal to shop and plan for at least three days worth of meals over the next week.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,And to shop for healthy snacks.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,Shop for three days worth of meals would be good.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"Next week, so if we stick to the same day, we can go back to that 10 a.m."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,time if you want.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,That works.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,"Yep, next Wednesday, the 26th at 10, correct?"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,"Okay, yes."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"All right, you too."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"Okay, bye-bye."
Margaret/6038.F.w4.7.10.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,We're in week five.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, and I asked you to read lesson five, Navigating Social Cues."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Yes, and I just reread it this morning."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"Oh, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,"So any big takeaways, or did you learn anything new, anything interesting?"
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I think some of it would have been more helpful.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"With the holidays being so far away, some of it doesn't apply right now."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"But just things about social gatherings, trying to ask for ice water, bringing a healthy snack, maybe eating before something."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,Those were good hints or good tips to be keeping in mind.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"And then your previous SMART goal, you said you wanted to shop and plan for at least three days' worth of meals."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,So were you able to do that?
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,I was.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"I was at the family cottage again this weekend, so maybe not the whole day worth, but planned two good meals each day."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"And either they were something I was eating myself or making for everybody, making available for everybody, just having some healthier options."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,And then I have two days' worth of meals planned for this week.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,So I think that helped.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"As always, data looked very good."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"So I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"It looks like you met your 1,800-calorie goal five of those days and then your 50-fat-gram goal six of those days."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,So very good job there.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,Seven days of physical activity recorded a total of 290 minutes.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,So you did surpass your 231-minute goal.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 213.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,I thought it said 214 this morning.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,I see 213.62.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,Maybe it rounded up.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"Yeah, I thought I said 214, but that's close enough."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"So a little bit faster, you know, generally we like one to two pounds."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"Three pounds is, like I said, a little bit faster than we like, but not too big of a deal."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"One thing that I wanted to bring up on this call, so kind of just looking at your data in general, you know, your goal is 1,800 calories, and I might have brought this up before."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,I'm not sure.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Generally, you're eating maybe around, like, 1,200."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Do you feel, like, full with those amount of calories?"
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"I wouldn't say I feel full, but I'm not –"
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"I'm not, you know what I mean?"
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"I'm not, sometimes I'm a little hungry, but it's, it's usually, okay, there's a meal coming up."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"Don't, you know, don't, you don't need to eat just because you feel like eating."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"At night, I'm a little hungry at night, but, you know, before going to bed, but not more of a, oh, I feel like I, I would like to eat something more than I can't take it."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,I'm so hungry.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,I don't know.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"I'm,"
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"I'm a little bit hungry, but not hungry enough that it's bothersome."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Yeah, the reason why I bring it up is because we just don't want you to lose too much weight too fast, and then, you know, if you start eating normally again, you're just going to gain all of that back."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"So, I mean, if that's just like a level that you're comfortable eating at, then, of course, you know, continue in doing that, but"
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"Looking at your calories and fat grams, you still have a lot of room to, you know, eat more."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Generally, your fat grams are maybe in like the 20s or 30s, and you know your blood sugar is 50 grams of fat."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"So, you know, a snack here and there I don't think would do too much."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"And I also, I think that there's things that I don't necessarily put down."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,Like I may have four almonds and forget to write that down kind of thing.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"I'm trying to always get those snacks, but I would say there's probably a little that I'm eating a little more than that."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"You know, I just wanted to ask about that."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"But like I said, otherwise you're doing very well."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"Okay, but that's good to keep in mind too."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"All right, then for our next call, just moving on to the lessons, so number six."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,That one is called Ways to Stay Motivated.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"So, you know, you're almost halfway through the study."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"So, you know, at this point we kind of just like to reassess, you know, where you are, how you've been doing with your progress."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Thinking something along the lines of scheduled exercise.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"I'm not, like on the weekends I'm good at it, but during the week I'm bad at saying, okay, I need to schedule time to do this."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"whether I maybe look for a class or do something where I'm setting up a schedule for actual exercise and doing it every, you know, not every day, but at that set time every week."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,So you want to schedule exercise during the week.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"During the week, yeah."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,Kind of add that in and try to make that a regular habit.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"And then our next call, so if this day and time generally works for you, next Wednesday at 10."
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"So that's going to be the second, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"Keep up the good work, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6038.F.w5.7.26.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,We are in week six of the study.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Were you able to get to lesson six, ways to stay motivated?"
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,It was.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,And what did you think of that lesson?
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I think it's good timing.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"It is, you know, we've been doing this for a few weeks, so staying motivated I think is a big focus."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,You are halfway done with this initial part of the intervention.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,I can't believe already six weeks have passed.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,I feel like time has just flown by.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,it has yeah i just kind of wanted to check in you know how are you feeling about your motivation good i think i'm feeling good about the motivation to um be more active it's the eating healthy is is harder to be stay as motivated about so i still am motivated but i'm more tempted to just eat some eat
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,certain things.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"Yes, I can definitely understand that, especially you've been so diligent with meeting the goals."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"It does get a little bit cumbersome after a while, but we just ask, hang in there a little bit."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"We can also talk about, you know, some ways to kind of alleviate that."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"Let's see, your SMART goal, let's see, you wanted to get in some scheduled exercise during the week."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,How did that go?
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,It went pretty well.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,I scheduled a couple different events.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,I've
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,Mainly I've been walking a lot and just walking around my neighborhood kind of gets boring.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,So I scheduled two walks where I went down to the 606 trail and walked that twice and trying to set up times that I'm supposed to be doing that.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,right then let's see looking at your data uh let's see you recorded at least a thousand calories six out of the seven days um looks like you might your calorie go three of those days and your fat gram go four of those days so there was a day where i didn't have a thousand calories yes uh okay i must have forgotten to add something then yeah no problem happens no big deal yeah okay um
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,notice a little bit of drop in meeting those goals definitely so generally you know you're usually maybe about like six days where you met the calorie goals five days where you met the fat grams um and i did see one particularly high day this past week uh yeah last saturday yeah 2000s but um you know like i said generally and i think what i may have done is record some of the
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,calories from one day onto that day.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,I'll double check that.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,It's not a big deal.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"No, I mean, I knew I was high, but I didn't think I went to 2,000, but I might have."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"So, um, with meeting the calorie goals, so let's see, you're at 1800 calories."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"So, um, you have a pretty decent amount, I would say, um, to kind of play around with."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"I definitely think, you know, you could kind of experiment a little bit here and there."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"So maybe, uh, having, you know, one, you know, cookie or something like that, making sure that the rest of your meals are a little bit more balanced, um,"
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,It's definitely not helpful to restrict yourself all the time because that's just not realistic for keeping this up long term.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"So I think finding, like, you know, a happy medium, sometimes, you know, treating yourself, but also, you know, recognizing that you do want to most of the time, you know, eat healthy."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,It's not just for weight loss.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,It's just for overall health in general.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"Right, right."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"Yeah, it does."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,And just finding ways to incorporate healthier foods in before I –
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,have that cheat food it's like okay but fill up um before you go to a party or fill up before you um make sure that i've eaten healthy all day and then if if that's the case then having that treat at night might not be so bad exactly um okay let's see then physical activity uh really great your goal was 263 minutes last week you did 302 minutes so really great job there go ahead give
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Yeah, that scheduled exercise really helps."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"Yes, awesome."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"And then let's see, most recent weight I see is 213."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Is that correct?
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"I do notice, so I've been, and I think this is the last weekend I'm going up there for a while, but when I go up to our cottage, I tend to drink a lot more water and then I tend to have"
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,a drink or two I find that my weight is significantly higher on Monday even if I've eaten healthy even if I take the alcohol out I think I'm just drinking so much more water all weekend that that kind of I have a heavier water weight every Monday Tuesday and then I go back to not that I don't drink water during the week I just don't drink as much I think that's kind of explains that fluctuation
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,noticed you had actually hit um 211 and then you went back up to 213 so that could definitely um yeah be water weight um you know everybody's body's different i know that they give like general guidelines for how much water you should be drinking but just do you know what you feel comfortable with yeah that really is water weight then you know we'll see your weight go back down yeah and i'm not not so worried about it i'm just curious about it as opposed to um and mainly up there it's
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"A, it's hot."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,It's just easier.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"There's nothing else really around a drink except, I don't know, heavy sugared drinks or alcohol."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,So I just try to drink more water.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"And then since we are, you know, like I said, halfway through the study, I did also want to check on how you're feeling about your progress so far."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"You've lost four pounds since we started the intervention, so that's definitely a good amount of weight."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,I'm feeling good.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,I'm feeling fine about the weight.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,I think I need to focus more on what I'm doing with regard to physical activity.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"I think walking for a couple weeks and just trying to do, while it's moderate, it's not exercise that's going to help me lose weight as much as I think I need to move to the next level with regard to physical activity."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,And kind of what did you have in mind?
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,I don't know if it's running or trying to sign up for
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"a gym with some physical training, but I know that just what I'm doing, walking and light yoga, it's good to get me back into being more physical."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"It's a good gateway, but if I want to make a real difference, I think I need to start running and or doing more cardio."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,makes sense and I think you know you're in a good place to do that right now slowly building up you know I think that would be okay did you want to go ahead and set that as your SMART goal maybe exploring new ways to get in physical activity and then we can kind of check in on that on our next call yeah I think that's what I was thinking about
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"And then for that next call, if you could just go ahead and read Lesson 7."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,That one is called Concrete Slip-Ups.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"And then for our next check-in call, so that's going to be next Wednesday, the 9th at 10 a.m."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,That works for me.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"All right, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w6.8.2.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"All right, thank you."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,We are in week seven of the study.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Lesson seven was called Conquering Slip-Ups.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yeah, I went through that one."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,What did you think of that?
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,I think it was good.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,It's easy to do that where you have a bad day or two and then you just kind of want to write off the rest of the week or a bad meal and you want to write off the rest of the day.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,So I think it was a good reminder of ways to kind of prevent that or get back on track if something like that does happen.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"I like the whole comeback plan, kind of just having things in mind to come back from going down the wrong road, especially around exercise."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"And have you encountered any, you know, slip-ups or anything like that recently?"
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"You know, I usually have, like, I'll have three good days and then I'll have a day where I'm just not as motivated and I don't get up and exercise and then, you know, kind of as the day goes on, something, you haven't done anything."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"So, yeah, I've had that."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,Have you found that it's been difficult for you to kind of bounce back
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"A little, but it's more like for a day."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"It's not like I find myself going, okay, then this is the whole week."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"I almost find, okay, so I had a day that wasn't as good as the other days."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,Let that go and now get back on track.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"And then let's see, your previous SMART goal, you had said you wanted to find new ways to get that physical activity in, so whether it be at the gym or anything like that."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,How did that go this past week?
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"Um, I did some investigating."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"I'm, uh, I've got one more appointment today at the Y. Okay."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Um, I'm going over and I've got a free pass set up for tomorrow."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"So I think if that works, I kind of looked into some other gym options and just between price and I think maybe they were just too like, um, orange fitness or something."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,I just don't see myself.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,I see myself doing it for a little while and then burning out real fast.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,So I'm thinking the Y might be the better fit.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"Um,"
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"So I have a free pass for tomorrow, and it's in the right budget range."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,And I also noticed that they have a class that's kind of around fitness.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"I forget what they call it, but it's like personal training, small classes, which is also affordable."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,I think just getting in and doing the Y for like a month or so and then maybe looking into that option.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Okay, yeah, those Orange Theory Fitness workouts are pretty intense, so..."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"Yeah, I don't think I'm there yet."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Looking at your data, so last week I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories five of the days."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,It looks like you met your calorie goal three of those days and your fat gram goal two of those days.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"Physical activity, five days recorded."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"I saw a total of 298 minutes, so literally two minutes away from that 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"Yeah, and I did want to mention that."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,So my goal all week had been 237 minutes or something.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,I was already on track to meet more.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"Woke up Sunday morning, I was laughing because I was at exactly 297 minutes, and I hadn't even done anything that day."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"But then like an hour later, it slipped to 300 for the week."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"I don't quite get, I get changing the goal, but it feels like it should happen for the next week."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,Like Monday it should flip instead of Sunday.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Yeah, it shouldn't change on Sunday."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,It should be changed on Monday.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,So I will go ahead and look into that.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Yeah, it was at 237 and it went to 300."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,So that was a pretty big jump.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 212.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,So that is a pound down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"So seeing that weight loss again, which is great."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,So is there anything that you wanted to bring up or talk about on this call?
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,No.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"Well, I wanted to mention the whole weight, the goal shifting, but..."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"Other than that, I guess just kind of asking how do those goals get reset?"
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Is it based on where I was at the previous week or?
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Correct.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"So based on, you know, how well you're doing at meeting the goals, that physical activity will change."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"Because one of the challenges is that I tend to have very light days, Monday, Tuesday, and then I have heavier days of physical activity Thursday through Sunday."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"Um, so just kind of timing wise, if it's held off till Monday, they'll see what my full minutes are."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"On Monday, it shouldn't matter, you know, it shouldn't matter overall the week."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,It shouldn't be by date.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,It definitely shouldn't be changed on Sunday.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,So I will look into that.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"Uh, so then for our next call, uh, just go ahead, read lesson, uh, eight."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"And then, uh, what would you like your SMART goals?"
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"And this is kind of a holdover, too, from last week, what they call burnout or whatever."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"It's more around getting new nutrition in, finding some new meal plan ideas that are more sustainable, so things that I can make on a regular basis."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,So I'd like to spend some time on some recipe research.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,looking into the Mediterranean diet and trying to figure out what I can do around that.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,"And then for our call next week, so that is going to be the 16th at 10."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,Next Wednesday?
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"Yes, that works."
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w7.8.9.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,so we are in week eight so definitely moving along here uh just yeah you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls uh let's see lesson eight was called food cravings and cues were you able to get that one i did i got through it and what do you think um i think that the food cravings is just kind of something i know it's always been i've
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,1,patient,"you know, it's part of life."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,"But the inactivity part, I mean, not that the craving didn't speak to me, but the inactivity part kind of spoke to me."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"I've been finding myself doing, falling into some bad habits around that while I'm off work this summer."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,So I think that's kind of an important reminder.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Things like I'll turn on a television show while I'm cleaning and then I end up sitting and watching part of it, you know, like supposedly it's just going to be on in the background, but"
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I end up getting sucked into it instead of getting my work done or getting my activity in.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,So I think that's an important issue.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Yeah, definitely."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,And then let's see your SMART goal.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"So you said you want to look for some new recipes, you know, for some foods that are kind of more sustainable, easy for you to, you know, consume and things like that."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,So how did that go?
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,Pretty good.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,I came up with a couple things that I've made.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"I did some cooking on Monday to have them, or actually I did it last Friday to have it through the weekend and whatnot."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,Was it Friday or earlier in the week?
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"Anyway, I did some turkey meatballs, homemade turkey meatballs."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"One of the things I crave is some sort of greasy food or something, and that's a good substitute in that it's,"
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,not overly fattening and yet it kind of gives me that cheeseburger kind of craving um fills that um and i made a whole wheat pasta salad that lasted me a couple days and i came up with a couple other good mediterranean style recipes that i can kind of have on hand to cook um like i'm not someone who's going to cook every night of the week so to have something and make it so it'll last and then i'll eat it again i don't mind eating something two nights in a row or
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,twice that week so i think i did well with that and it's something i need to continue okay great so let's see looking at your data another really great week saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories all seven days met your calorie goal six of those days and your fat gram goal five of those days uh physical activity across six days i see 308 minutes so you did meet that 300
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,I did.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"There was one day last week I found my bracelet, my bracelet, my watch wasn't, I don't know if it wasn't on right or what, but I'd had a fairly active, more active day than what it showed."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"And once I reset that watch, it just didn't hit any active minutes when I was doing activity that normally I would hit active minutes with."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"Yeah, it might have just been a glitch, but it does seem like you did hit your goal anyway."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"Yeah, I did."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,I did.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,I just need to be aware of that watch.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"And on the one hand, I was trying to get away from looking at it constantly to just kind of, okay, do your activity."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,Don't be so focused on how many minutes have you gotten.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,But I need to keep an eye and make sure it's recording what it's supposed to be.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"And then most recent weight, I see 211."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"This morning, yes."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"So there was a little bit of a jump I saw over the past few days, but it looks like it came back down."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"You know, and I weighed myself later in the day."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"I forgot in the morning, so maybe that was part of it."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Yeah, no problem."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"So 211, so that's another pound down from the last time we checked in."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"So you're still losing weight, still doing very well in meeting the goals."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,So really great job with that.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,And then that next lesson is going to be number nine.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,That one is just called Stress Management.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"I think around inactivity, so limiting television and kind of casual Internet use to maybe one hour a day."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"So when you're talking about kind of wanting to be more active, do you mean generally throughout the day, just like getting up more, not actual physical activity, correct?"
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"You know, I think I get my activity in."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"It's the inactivity where I get sucked in and just do nothing for a little while because I'm watching TV or I'm playing on the Internet when I should be doing other things, whether it's physical activity or cooking or getting chores done, that kind of thing."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,So just limiting.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"The Chapter 8 really talked to, you know,"
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Limiting your inactivity.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,So getting rid of those things that kind of distract you.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"And then for our call next week, so next Wednesday is the 23rd."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,That's going to be at 10.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Then I'll check in with you then.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,Have a good week.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,Two things.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"I did get a note that I need to reschedule my final, not final, but my three-month."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,So I'll get back to that today.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,I'll get an answer to that today.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,I need to come up with some times.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"And then just to mention, because I don't know if I'm one of the first ones doing this or not, in the SMART Lesson 8, there is a typo where it says Lesson 9 in that lesson."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Oh, thanks for letting us know."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,I will definitely take that.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"Yeah, no big deal."
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"I just noticed it, and I was like, wait, which week am I on?"
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,Sure.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"All right, then have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,Thanks.
Margaret/6038.F.w8.8.16.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Week 9, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,We'll just be going over our regular agenda today.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"So Lesson 9, Stress Management."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"I did, but honestly, I looked at it last week, and I was trying to remember it this morning."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"I would have pulled it up normally yesterday, and I didn't."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,I seem to remember that definitely trying to find ways to make sure I don't stress eat.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"I'm not so much a stress eater as a boredom eater, so it's that."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"And I think there were tips on using exercise to manage stress, which I think that is something I need to focus on, like resorting to that when I'm feeling stressed, saying, okay, just get up and go do something, go exercise, go for a walk, go..."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,manage it that way but alright then let's see your previous SMART goal so in order to like get in more physical activity you wanted to limit your TV and internet usage were you able to do that last week no I had well I did but on Wednesday of last week I fell and I I sprained my wrist and kind of threw my back out so like a day and a half I was not I was just kind of laying on the floor
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,trying to get better.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"So I watched a little more TV and I didn't exercise very much those two days, but I think I bounced back from it."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"And then I was, I think the idea of limiting that most days is a good idea."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,It does help me.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,I found it was working earlier in the week.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"I got up and walked the trail and then came home and made sure not to have the TV on and got my work done before I had anything on or was able to, you know, use the internet for just"
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,recreational purposes.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,How is your back and wrist doing?
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,The wrist is better.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"And my back, it was just kind of one of those falls that jarred me."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"It wasn't really that bad of a fall, but I don't know, for a day or two."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,And I went to the chiropractor on Thursday.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,That seemed to help.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"By Friday, Saturday, I was feeling better."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"And I was still able to meet my exercise goal, so I'm happy about that."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Yes, you did."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,I did see that.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Last week, over five days, you did 316 minutes."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,So definitely met that goal.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,And then the diet portion was great as well.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"I said that you recorded at least 1,000 calories six of the days."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,You met your calorie goal all six of those days and your fat gram goal four of those days.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Most recent weight I see entered today is 209, is that correct?"
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Yeah, so that is a big drop, three pounds down."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Also means that you have officially met your weight loss goal for the study, so congratulations."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Good, good."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,All that work has definitely paid off.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"So you still have, you know, a decent amount of time left in the study, about a month or so."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So considering that, kind of, what did you want to do now?"
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Do you still want to continue to lose weight, or..."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,I would.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"I mean, I definitely need to continue to lose weight."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"So, you know, another, I mean, I would love to get another five pounds down by, say, the study ends after Labor Day or before, I can't remember."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"The last call is after, so by then."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Well, that's just two weeks away, but still."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"If I could get another two to four pounds down, that would be great."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Then for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 10."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,That one is called Mindfulness.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"So this one is really just talking about paying attention to the foods that you're putting into your body, chewing slower, things like that."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,And what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,To not have any accidents.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,I think to...
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,It really needs to be exercise-based.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,I'd actually like to increase it.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"I mean, I'm still at 300, I think, but I'd like to try to hit a little more, maybe 320, even up to 350 minutes this week."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,I think...
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"I haven't recorded my exercise for today yet, but I think with what's going on, I'll be able to do that."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"So yeah, we can say maybe hitting at least 320 minutes and then of course over that then, you know, even better."
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,Then for our call next week.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,So would Wednesday be okay?
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,It'll be fine.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,So that's going to be the 30th.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6038.F.w9.8.24.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Have a great day.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,We are in week three.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, okay?"
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"So generally, these calls kind of all have a similar format."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,So we'll be going over that lesson that we've asked you to read.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"We'll be going over all of your self-monitoring data, so your calories, any physical activity."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"We'll just kind of talk about how that's going in general, any successes or challenges you've had."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"Then I'll just ask about the text messages, and then we'll set our first SMART goal."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,So we can go ahead and get started here.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Have you been keeping up with the Lesson 3 tiers?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"I actually completely forgot about those, so no."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,13,unknown,"All right, then for our next form, I'm just going to go ahead and ask you to read Lesson 4."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,14,unknown,Do you remember how to access those?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,I think I still have it.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"It's on that, like, packet, right?"
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"Okay, yeah, I have that, so I'll look"
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,over your data so for that I am looking at from July 27th until yesterday August 2nd okay okay so I saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories six out of seven days in that time frame so really great job there remember I had said during that randomization session we really want people to eat at least that much we just know it's a good number to keep your body going
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,And then it looks like you met your calorie goal five of those days and your fat gram goal three of those days.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"So doing pretty decently, kind of how have you been feeling about meeting the goals and, you know, what have you been doing so far?"
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"Well, I think it's easier until I, like, go out to eat."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"There are, like, some places where I, if they're not, like, a bigger chain, it's kind of hard to, like, figure out."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,how many calories something is.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"Like, yesterday I went to, like, a smaller restaurant and there was, I tried, like, I tried to get, like, the average of things, but it was, they just had, like, such specific menu items that I had to kind of best guess what they had."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"And then there's some, I was, like, wondering if, should I track it by the app?"
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Because, like, I, like, looked at, like, the Starbucks menu and, like, what was written on their menu was different than what was, like, on the app."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"I don't know if I should, like, create the custom item or if I should just use what's on the app."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,I would just use what's in the app just for convenience.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Is the difference really, you know, large?"
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"So, like, I went, like, went off."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"Like, I get, like, a breakfast sandwich from there, and I, like, looked at the menu on there, and they have it, like, written out there, and it was, like, about 150 calorie difference and then, like, two grams of fat, which I don't know how big of a difference that is."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Right.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"Just make sure, like in our app, that the serving size is correct."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Sometimes the default, you know, serving size might not be the one that the default one that they use at Starbucks, like when they list it."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,That might be the difference.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Otherwise, you know, I would just go ahead and use what's in our app."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So in general, do you feel like you've been having any difficulty meeting the goals or do you feel like you're struggling with one of them?"
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"No, like I said, it's just kind of hard to track when I go out, but when I'm at home, I think it's fine."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"All right, then let's see."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Looking at physical activity, I see four days recorded."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Last week, your goal was 300 minutes."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"I saw you did 186, so not quite at that 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,What have you been doing to kind of get physical activity in?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"So I actually had to unexpectedly go away, so I didn't have access to my gym membership."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"But, yeah, but this week me and my roommate go to the gym together, so I think it's been a little bit better."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"All right, and then most recent weight I see is 197."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"So, you know, just looking at your data, doing pretty well in the study."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Not too bad.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Maybe just looking at the fat grams a little more closely.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"You know, you're over that on some of the days, not outrageous by any means, but maybe just paying more attention to that."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"Otherwise, everything is looking pretty good."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"Is there anything that you wanted to bring up about any of the goals or your data, things like that?"
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"I just had a question, I guess, about fat grams."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"I know, like, within the calories, there's, like, kind of a range."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"Is there, like, a minimum that needs to be met for fat grams, or does that not?"
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Sounds good.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,That's really my only question.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,And then just wanted to check in about those text messages.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,Have you been receiving those from us?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Then for that next call, like I said, if you could just go ahead and read Lesson 4, that would be great."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,And then we can go ahead and set your first SMART goal.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,So have you ever heard of SMART goal setting?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,I have not.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,So basically this is just going to be a goal that we set on every call.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"It's going to be something that you feel like you can work on in a one-week period that will kind of help push you towards this overall goal of, like, behavior change, weight loss, things like that."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,So do you have anything in mind that you feel like you can work on this week?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,I think definitely tracking before I eat things as opposed to after.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"Oh, yeah."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,That's a good one.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,And then does this day and time generally work for you or for a call next week?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"Okay, let's see."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,"Oh, actually, I'm not going to be available next week at 10."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,What is another day and time that generally works for you?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"I don't know if you're available any time Thursday, but all day Thursday pretty much works for me."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"But Wednesday after, I think it's 1 p.m."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,How about next Thursday at 1230?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,"Yeah, perfect."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"Then I will put you down for that day and time, and I will talk to you then."
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6045.A.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,"Thank you, too."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,We are in week four.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Lesson four was called Making Smart Food Choices.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,And what did you think of that?
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Um, yeah, no, I think it mostly made sense and it's probably stuff that I kind of knew, probably been thinking about a little bit more."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"Um, I think like most of the time if I go out, like I'm able to kind of utilize some of those decision points."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"I think the harder part is not like normal restaurants, but like fast food restaurants."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"Um, so like I found myself literally looking at like nutritional charts at Subway the other day, like what should I eat and what should I not eat kind of a thing."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"But, um, you know, uh, trying to do that in very, very much moderation as well."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"So, um, but yeah, in general, I think that that whole lesson made sense and it was pretty easy to follow."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,So.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"Uh, let's see then your smart goal."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,You had said you want to go to sleep earlier.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,and getting in more of that stair exercise.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,So how did that go?
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"I think the sleep is slowly getting back on track or, you know, on better track."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,I probably did a little better this week than the week before.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"I'd still like to see some improvements, but what's great is I utilize – I've got a smart watch, and so it's got a sleep tracker on it, so I'm really able to, like, watch that data."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,So that's getting better.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"The steer piece, I think I found that I didn't have as many opportunities because I wasn't, like, running up and down, you know, like, in my building, you know, the same amount."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,And so I think I kind of halfway through realized that I need to make a modification to that goal that I actually kind of started yesterday as well.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"All right, then."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Looking at your data, I saw some..."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,fantastic recording this past week so in terms of physical activity i saw all seven days recorded you did a total of 382 minutes so still meeting that 300 minute goal which is great and then for the diet portion i saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories all seven days and you met your calorie and fat gram goal all seven days so really really great job there um that's amazing um kind of what did you do this past week to really keep yourself accountable
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,I'm a good student.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,I like to hit my goals.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"You know, I don't know."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"I think some of the things that I was doing, you know, like I think I mentioned before, I feel like the food tracking is so super informative."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"And so every day and every week I'm kind of learning, like, things that I might normally eat and not even think twice about that I didn't think were, quote, that."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"are actually, like, you know, worse than I thought."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,So I'm just kind of watching that and making small changes and decisions.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"And, like, I've done things like go to the grocery store and..."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Um, pick up like, you know, crisp bars and things of that nature as, you know, snacks during the day."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"Um, I've made it a point to kind of, um, I'm really bad about eating fruit."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,I always have been.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"I'll eat vegetables like crazy, but fruit not so much."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"So I'm like making it a point to like go pick up like fresh fruit a couple of times a week to make sure that like, and getting that in at breakfast time."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,um because I don't really eat a lot of sweets and so that's part of the reason why I don't usually have fruit around the house um and then like if I realize that I've done really bad in the you know daytime then um I make some really conscious decisions about what it is that I'm you know eating for dinner or whatever just to make sure that I'm not bumping over so that's been it so far I feel like I need a cheat day though um
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Do you feel like you're getting a little bit exhausted from sticking to the goals?
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Yeah, and I actually kind of realized over the weekend, I'm all like, oh, my God, like, I'm working so hard to, like, make this happen, and I'm like, and I've been all right about, like, oh, someone pulled out a box of cookies the other day."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"I was like, okay, I'll have one cookie, you know, like, one kind of a thing, but, like, I just, there's a certain point where I'm like, I really like cheese, and I really want to, like, eat something that has a ton of cheese and not care about, like,"
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"how bad this one meal is going to be, you know?"
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Can we compromise and say, you know, like, one meal instead of one day?"
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,I actually have that planned for Thursday night.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"So, yeah."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"But, like, I'll be better during the day."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"Like, I'll pay attention to what I'm eating during the day."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"And then, like, Thursday night is, like, my football's on."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,I'm going to have a bad meal.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"No, that's fine."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"You know, really we do want this to be, you know, lifelong changes, not something that you just do for 12 weeks and then stop because, you know, it's not feasible."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"So, of course, you know, if you're feeling exhausted, you want to have, you know, a meal here and there, that's fine by us."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,It's not a big deal.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,But let's see.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 188.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,uh yeah yes so another pound down so doing really great um and yesterday you were you weighed in at 187 so you know it's probably still going to go down from there so overall doing really great um let's see then for our next call if you could go ahead read lesson five that one is called navigating social cues gatherings and holidays um and then what would your smart goal to be okay
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"Well, so because, like, the whole, like, stare thing I was trying to do last week, I was like, oh, you know, there's just not as many opportunities."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"I think like my bigger thing is I've been watching like my steps over the last, you know, three to four weeks because I've had a step tracker through a different device anyway."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"And just seeing that really fluctuate depending on like what my work schedule is and, you know, how many days I literally just have to sit in front of the computer for most of the day."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"And so I really, really want to make sure that I'm averaging 10,000 steps a day."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"And, uh, so I really kind of even looked at that yesterday because Monday, three days a week, I work 10 hour days and I sit at a computer all day long."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"Um, so just trying to flip flop between while on the days where I know I'm sitting most of the day, like go down and get on the treadmill or get on the elliptical as a way to like, um,"
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"you know, get the bulk of those in and make sure that I'm, like, bumping those up because it could be very possible that I sit and I only, like, walk 3,500 or 4,000 steps in a day if I don't, you know, consciously make that effort."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"So it's a big goal, but it's what I want to do."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,Sounds like a good goal.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"I definitely think, you know, that moderation is very important, but, you know, also keeping yourself accountable, you know, making sure that, you know, you're active, you know, for some part of the day at least."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,I think that's definitely helpful.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"Yeah, and, like, days when I'm not, like, sitting at my desk like that all day long, I'm usually fairly active, and it's fairly easy to reach that without, like, really working too hard at it."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"But, you know, on those other days, it's much more difficult."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"So it's, like, three days a week that I really have to concentrate on it."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"And then our call next week, so next Tuesday is the 15th at 1."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"Yeah, I believe so."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"I think the two weeks after that I might need to make a little switch from some changes with my work schedule, but next week I should be still good."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,Then I will check in with you.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,"Then have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6045.A.w4.8.8.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,We are in week five.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Lesson five was called Navigating Social Cues, Gatherings, and Holidays."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I was.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"Any big takeaways, or did you feel like it was relevant to you at all?"
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Yeah, I'm actually going on vacation tomorrow, so I think it was good timing."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"Oh, awesome."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,Where are you going?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"I'm going to Denver, so it's going to be a lot of hiking."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"I mean, it's like an active vacation, but I still think, like,"
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"what we, like, pack for lunch, and, like, I mean, we're doing, like, full days of hiking, but still, like, we'll be, like, going out to eat in a group afterwards, so we'll still be very social."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Yeah, so definitely those are probably going to present a lot of challenges."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,Have you kind of given any thought to it at all about what you want to do?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"Yeah, so I think, like, for, we're leaving early in the morning, and I think it'll be, like, we'll be gone for most of the day, so we'll have to, like, pack food ahead of time."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"So I think if I just pack healthier things, I won't, like, I'll be able to stick to that."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"I just think, I don't know what restaurants we're going to, so hopefully there's, like, healthier options."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,But I think that'll be the trickier part.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Like, I think the morning and the afternoon will be easier."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,So I think I'm just going to try to keep it super healthy then.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"So even if it is, like, an unhealthier dinner, it won't be as bad."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"Okay, then let's see."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"Your previous SMART goal, so we really wanted to focus on physical activity, so trying to get to the gym more."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,How did that go this past week?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,I think it went well.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"I think I just barely reached my goal, but I made an effort."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"I traveled all day, but I got back pretty early, and I still kind of went to the gym to kind of try to stick with it."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Then let's see, looking at your data this past week, I saw you recorded at least 1,000 calories five of the days."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,And then it looks like you met your calorie goal all five of those days.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Didn't quite hit the fat gram goal any of those days, though."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,So still something we might want to pay a little bit of attention to.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,Do you feel like it's just kind of like the food choices that you're making that need to be changed or serving sizes?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,Kind of what are your thoughts?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"I think it's food choices, and it's just –"
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"I think even when I try to eat, like, healthier, like, I went to the salad bar, but there are, like, things that I, like, didn't... I don't know."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"I think, like, I used olive oil instead of dressing, and I thought that was healthier, but then when kind of, like, calculating the fat, it's still, like, a lot more than I thought it would be."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Definitely looking through your food log, generally a lot of healthy choices, so that's really good."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Maybe just a few...
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,changes here and there.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So, um, uh, like any ice cream or things like that, you know, of course that is going to have a lot of like dairy in it."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"That's probably, you know, a big indicator."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"Um, maybe cutting back a little bit on some of the chicken, but generally it looks like, you know, that's not too bad."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Um, maybe some of the meat options as well."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Um, it definitely gets complicated because like you said, there are things that are often like"
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Like you said, olive oil, you know, you'd think that would be better than dressing, but it actually has a lot more fat grams."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"It looks like generally you're maybe around like 46 fat grams, 49 fat grams, which is, you know, barely over your budget."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,So I wouldn't worry too much.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Maybe just making a few changes here and there or even cutting back a little bit might help, but we'll kind of see as we go along."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"Physical activity, five days recorded."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,You did 281 minutes.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,So you did hit that 268-minute goal.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"And then for this week, your goal bumped up to 300 minutes."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,Did you see that in the app?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,I did.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"And then most recent weight, I see 197."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"I thought it was lower, but I thought..."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"I didn't weigh myself this morning before I left for work, but let me see what I..."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,Maybe that is right.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,I don't know why I thought it was lower.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,I have not weighed myself today.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,I'll have to do that when I get home.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"Yeah, I just wanted to make sure."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"I see 197 on my end, but even so, that's two pounds down from the last time we checked in, so you're doing very well."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Probably, like you said, this traveling is going to be your biggest challenge, but hopefully some of the activity will offset that."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,So we'll kind of check in on that next time.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Then I just want to ask, are you still receiving those in-app text messages?"
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"All right, then for our next lesson, or yes, our next lesson, if you go ahead read lesson six, that one is called Ways to Stay Motivated."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"So by the next time we talk, you'll be halfway done with this kind of initial part of the study."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"So just kind of want to assess your progress, check in how you're feeling, maybe talk about spaces that you want to improve in the next six weeks, things like that."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,I think I want to try to keep the fat within the kind of allowed area.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,And then what is a good day and time for you to talk next week?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"I get back Wednesday, so Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,"Let's go ahead then and do Wednesday, just so you kind of have one day to settle in."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"How about 1 o'clock, or excuse me, Thursday, I meant."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,So that's going to be the 24th at 1.
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"Yeah, perfect."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"All right, then I will check in with you then."
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"Have a great week and enjoy your trip, okay?"
Margaret/6045.A.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"All right, so let's see."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Week six, just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Lesson six was called Ways to Stay Motivated.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I did not.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Sorry, I just got back and I have all the work to catch up on from my trip."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"I'm just going to ask you to read two for our next call, okay?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,So lesson six and seven.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,Sounds good.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"Really on this call, you know, with that lesson we wanted to talk about,"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Well, it's just kind of how you were doing with your motivation."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"We do know, you know, the study is one year, so it is a huge commitment, and your motivation can, you know, wane."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"So at this point in time, you know, kind of how are you feeling so far?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"Well, it's hard because I feel like I'm doing what I should be doing, but then I gain weight, so I don't know."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"It's a little – I mean, I obviously want to stay with it, so I think I'm just going to have to alter what I'm doing even more, like more so than –"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"what's recommended, but yeah."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,I can definitely understand how that is frustrating.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"And I do know that generally you've been doing very well with meeting the goals, but it doesn't quite seem like your weight is falling."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,So one thing that we've suggested was to kind of
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"watch the fat grams, so you wanted to make sure that you were staying within that 42 gram budget."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"So just thinking about trying to do that last week, how did that kind of go?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"I think just being on the trip, it was harder than I thought it would be, so yeah."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Yeah, I can definitely imagine."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,Do you travel very often?
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,I do for work.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"This was just like a hiking trip, so I mean, this was more a vacation, but I do travel"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,pretty often for work.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Yeah, so it does seem like that is going to be probably a big barrier for you and something that we're going to have to learn to kind of, you know, navigate since it's obviously not going to go away anytime soon."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"But again, like I said, it does seem like, you know, you're..."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,still being with generally meeting the goals.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"So looking at your data, last week I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories six of the days."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"You met your calorie goal all six of those days, and you met your fat gram goal four of those days."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"So according to the data, you know you're doing very well."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Do you feel like that's all accurate?
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Yeah, I just think that the food I'm choosing, like I know that, like, it's staying within that, but, like,"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"If I, like, pick pasta, like, it's got, like, less fat, but then I'm like, that's really not, like, I think it stays within it, but I know it's, like, not the best choice."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"So, you're kind of talking about, like, actual food choices now, right?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Not just the numbers, but you also, like, overall healthy choices, yeah."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,And definitely understand that.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"So, maybe that is something that maybe we want to pay attention to, you know, in the"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Just looking at your data, you know, generally it's really not too bad."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"It seems like, you know, you're eating regularly, so it's not like you're skipping meals or anything like that, correct?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,Right.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Yeah, so I guess now would probably be a good time to kind of play around a little bit, and I think you're right."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,A good place to start would be kind of switching out some food choices.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,So did you kind of have an idea in mind in kind of what you might want to increase in your diet or what you might want to decrease?
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"Yeah, I think just even though, like, when I, like, look at them, like, a lot of the carby foods, like, don't have as much fat, I still know they're not, like, not as good."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"So maybe replace, like, pastas and carbs with, like, more vegetables and alternatives like that."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,increase in the vegetable intake will definitely help.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Physical activity was looking really good.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"Across six days, you did 372 minutes."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,So you did meet the 300-minute goal.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 200.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"So unfortunately, yeah, that is up from the last time we checked in."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"Do you feel like you're eating also, like, particularly salty foods?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Um...
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"Maybe on this trip, because we kind of were, like, we had to pack food, so I feel like maybe packaged foods are probably more healthier."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"Right, right."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"Yeah, yeah."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"So probably, you know, something else, but that doesn't sound like, you know, that's a regular thing."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"So, you know, a few things to kind of keep in mind."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"We can go ahead and, like you said, just start off by changing those food choices, and then I will also ask maybe my supervisor some things."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,that we can kind of change a little bit within some ideas I can give you.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,So hopefully we can kind of figure this out with these last six weeks.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"Um, is there anything that you want to bring up on this call or that you want to talk about?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"I don't know if it was just like, cause I had to change the battery."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"So I don't know if that was why the Fitbit was like a little strange, but so we did a lot of hiking."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"So we did one hike and it's like my like activity level, but was it like 120 minutes?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,And then we did another one that day.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"So I like imagined it would go up, but I checked it again and it dropped to 50."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"So I don't know if it was just like glitch with the battery, but I don't know how it would have gone down."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,doing more hikes so yeah that is kind of weird um was that last week yeah yeah um i'm not sure maybe it was just like a glitch i think a few other people have mentioned like there was a day where like it didn't either it didn't go through or like something had happened so it might either be like you know fitbit was updating something or something happened on our end but um
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,Everything seems fine on our end now.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"Do you feel like now, you know, it's recording everything pretty accurately?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"Yeah, I think it might have just been the battery, so I'll kind of keep an eye on it."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,They've just changed it.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"Yeah, well, thank you for letting us know."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,I'll go ahead and make a note of that.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"And definitely, if that happens in the future, just, you know, shoot me a quick email or just tell me again."
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,"We'll get it kind of sorted, okay?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,Sounds good.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,"Then, like I said, for our next – oh, really quick."

Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,I'm going to put my calendar up.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,I think right now any time other than 11 to 1 on Wednesday works.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,How about 945?
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,Would that be okay?
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,On Wednesday?
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,Sounds good.

Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6045.A.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,You too.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week eight."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Let's see, have you been keeping up with the lessons by any chance?"
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"I know that we didn't connect last week, but the last one I had asked you to read was six and seven."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Do you happen to remember those?
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,And what did you think of those lessons?
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"I think it motivated, obviously, that it was interesting, like the"
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"intrinsic versus extrinsic, um, motivation."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"And then the slip of one was good because I think where I usually, like, when I slip up, like, I kind of tend to give up and, like, how it explains that people, like, slip, slide, another one."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"So, like, just, like, the pointing out that, like, slipping up is, like, normal, like, when you're starting a new lifestyle change and, like,"
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"I don't know, I think that was good because that's usually the problem I run into when I do one thing wrong, that I kind of use that as an excuse to keep not doing other things."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Yeah, that makes sense."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,And then let's see then.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Looking at your data, so I'm looking at one week until yesterday."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"So last Wednesday, that's going to be August 30th until yesterday."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"September 5th, so that seven-day period."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories two of these days, and then it looks like you met your calorie goal two of those days, and then your fat-gram goal one of those days."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"So in general, recording was a little bit spotty."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,Was this a particularly busy week for you?
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Yeah, and I think it was just a lot of going out, which..."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"It's just harder, I think, when I, like, go out and I just don't, like, when I'm out with people, I don't tend to, like, take out my phone and then kind of track things."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Yeah, so definitely understand that."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"When you are, you know, out with people, though, do you try to kind of, like, keep these goals in mind, you know, trying to make the best choice?"
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"Yeah, so I, like..."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"My, like, last time we talked, I wanted to, like, make, like, better food changes, not just to, like, stick with that."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"So I've cut out, like, for now, most dairy and, like, sugar and grains."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"So I've been kind of sticking to, like, fruits, vegetables, meats, and, like, nuts."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,And then let's see.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Physical activity.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,So physical activity was great.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"Across six days, you did 365 minutes."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Last week since your goal was 300 minutes, so you did meet that goal and then that goal is gonna stay at 300 Since that is the maximum we will ask you to do and then most recent weight I see is 193."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Yeah, so from last Wednesday you weighed in at 197 so that is a four pound difference so a little bit faster than we'd like but Definitely still seeing that downward trend."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,So everything is looking good
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or anything that you wanted to talk about?
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"No, I don't think so."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"Then just wanted to make sure, are you still receiving those in-app text messages?"
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"I do, but sometimes I see that I have a message for one and I go into the app and it's not there anymore."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Okay, I will check up on that."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"And then, let's see, for our next call, if you could go ahead and take a look at lessons eight and nine."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Those are both pretty brief, so it shouldn't be too bad."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be?
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"I guess to keep with the, like, cutting out sugar and dairy, but also trying to meet the calorie requirement."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"One minute, because since I've cut that out, I've had, like, a cut time getting to the minimum."
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6045.A.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"And then for our call next week, what is a good day and time you would like to talk?"

Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,1,patient,I thought the food craving one was interesting.
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,The whole distractions and kind of what causes you to eat.
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,I think I've definitely done that where I kind of mindlessly do something and end up eating a lot more than I would have if I hadn't been distracted.
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"out sugars and dairy, but also trying to meet the calorie limit."
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,How did that go this past year?
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"I've been sick, so not well, because I just haven't really been eating a lot of anything."
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I'm sorry to hear about that.
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,Is it a cold or flu?
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"The flu, so, yeah."
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"What's that been, like trying to get into physical activity and all that?"
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"Yeah, also tricky."
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"I mean, I, like, will live in the city, so I still, like, end up walking a lot of places, so I think that kind of helps."
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"But, yeah, just, like, walking to the doctors and pharmacies and things like that."
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Okay, well, let's go ahead and take a look at your data."

Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,I think I'd want to try to repeat the one that I had last week since I wasn't able to get to that one.
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6045.A.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,And then next Wednesday is going to be the 20th.

Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"So I started to kind of step away and, like, take, like, the half hour for lunch and kind of that's, like, the small way I've been able to implement it so far."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"And then, sorry, did you want to say something else?"

Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Then your SMART goal, you said you wanted to cut out sugar and dairy, but also, you know, trying to meet that calorie limit."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,How did that go?
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,I think better than before.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"Still a little lower, I think."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"Yeah, I do see for the most part, let's see, five days where you record at least 1,000 calories, so definitely higher than last time."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"I know it's a little bit of a challenge, but it looks like, you know, overall you're doing pretty good."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"You did meet your calorie goal all five of those days, and then you met your fat gram goal four of those days, so good job there."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"Four days of physical activity recorded, you did 263 minutes, so maybe just like one workout shy of that."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,And most recent weight I see is 191.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,So that is another pound down from last time we checked in.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,And you're one pound away from your goal.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,How is this upcoming week looking?
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,I'm traveling for five days.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"So, yeah."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,So it might be a little tricky this week.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,But hopefully.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Like I think this week I want to like focus on getting the workouts in while traveling.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"Yeah, I think so."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"Yeah, I think that's like the toughest part about traveling."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"And I downloaded those videos, but like on longer days or days when I kind of go out after work, it gets a little tougher."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Sounds good.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"For that call, if you could read Lesson 11, that one is called Balance Your Thoughts."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,Then we have your SMART goal down.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So for our call next week, will you still be able to talk?"
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"Yeah, I'll be back next Wednesday, yeah."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"So next Wednesday, that's the 27th at 2.30."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,Perfect.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"All right, then I will check in with you then."
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,Have a good week and enjoy your travels.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6048.A.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Have a good week.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Alright, so we are officially in week one of the study, and then I just wanted to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,Sure.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Alright, so on this call, we'll be going over that lesson that I asked you to read, all of your data and your goals, and then we will go ahead and set your first SMART goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"But before we get into that, I did get your email about the scale."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,What did Fitbit support tell
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Well, they had a few things to check on, and I think we're okay on a couple of them."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"You know, we don't – this is getting into an area of technology that we don't understand that well."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"You know, like, is your security setting, I don't know, WPA, WEP, or WEP1 or whatever, you know?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,It's kind of esoteric stuff.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"So I think a problem or the problem could be that our SSID number on our router has a dash in it, and they say that it has to be alphanumeric only."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"So, but, you know..."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"I have to check with Comcast and do some online searching to see what the unintended consequences are of changing that because if we have to go through and change everything in our house on, you know, all of our various connections because we changed that number, it's just going to drive us over the edge, you know?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,I mean...
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"So I don't understand why they can't, it seems like, I mean Comcast, it's a Comcast router and it has a dash in it and the SSID number."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,So Comcast has a near monopoly.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"You would think that Fitbit could come up with a scale that could take a dash, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,But I can't think what else it could be because I have tried it.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"both on my phone, and I've tried it on the computer, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"I've followed all the instructions to a T, you know, many times, and it's just not connecting."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,I get an error message.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"So... Thank you, you know, for being so thorough about that."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"You know, you were really going out of your way to get that skill to work, and we really appreciate it."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,One thing I will say is that really the entire point of the skill...
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"is really just for the participants' convenience, you know, making that weighing easier."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"If this is, you know, just becoming too much of a headache and you don't mind just entering your weight in manually in the morning, you know, that's fine with us as well."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"To go through and change, you know, all the, like, the numbers on your router and, you know, going through all of this just really sounds like a lot, but, you know,"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Well, I think I'll take it one more step and just see what changing that number involves and how painful that's going to be."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"And if it's not that painful, then we may do it."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"Because, you know, I mean, I kind of like the idea of the scale."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"If I can get it to work, then after I give it back, maybe I would get another one, you know?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"So, but I..."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,But I can only take that so far.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,So thank you.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,I appreciate not absolutely having to do it.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"Yeah, of course."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"And then, yeah, of course, keep me updated, and then I'll try to let you know if you figure out anything on our end, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,So I asked you to read Lesson 1 for this call.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,I was.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,And what did you think of that lesson?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"Well, I mean, it was pretty basic, you know, but..."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"But it, you know, it kind of helps to kick things off, so it was fine."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"And then to go over your data, so since your intervention just started on Monday, I'm only going to be looking at Monday and Tuesday so far."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"So out of these two days, I do see that you recorded at least 1,000 calories both days, so thank you for that."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Remember that we want people to at least eat this amount, so..."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"You are doing that, which is great."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,And then I do see that you met your calorie goal both of those days and then your fat gram goal one of those days.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"So, so far off to a very good start."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,How are you feeling about these goals right now?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"Yeah, I feel fine about them."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,They seem fairly reasonable.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"And then I see one day physical activity entered so far, a total of 42 minutes, so well on your way to that 60-minute goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"Yeah, and I wanted to ask about that because I couldn't figure out, it didn't seem to let me, it might be too late now, because I know, I couldn't figure out how to enter my weight or my physical activity on Monday, I mean, after I missed Monday."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"So I was able to enter the food, but not the weight or the activity, or at least I couldn't figure out how to do it."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,And I don't anticipate missing a day.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"It was just because of, well, I was actually away over the weekend, and I had to deal with the scale."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"Anyway, I just ran out of time on Monday."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"So, although, really, if I had known I couldn't enter my weight, that would have taken me a few seconds, but I just thought, oh, I'll do that tomorrow."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,So can you enter the weight?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"Can I still, it's probably, I don't know, can I still enter the weight in the activity for Monday?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Sure.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"And as I said, I forgot the Fitbit on Monday."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"You know, some of this is just a matter of habit."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"You know, I just, like I said, I was dealing with the scale, and then I left for work, and it's like, oh, shoot, I didn't put that thing on."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"So, unfortunately, you can only go one day back in the app, so I'm trying on Monday."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"Since it's already Wednesday, you can't do that."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,It's really not a big deal since we do have a most recent wait in there.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"You know, of course, like I said during that session, this isn't going to be a perfect process."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,It's not going to be 100% accurate.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"So, you know, missing a day or two there isn't that big of a deal."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"Just trying to be, you know, on top of things most of the time."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Sure.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 193.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"So far, everything looks pretty good on my end."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,It looks like we're off to a good start.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"I don't have much to comment on since we only have a few days worth of data, but is there anything you wanted to bring up on this call?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,Just that I don't know.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,I'm sure there's a reason why you used the Spring app rather than
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,"you know, something like MyFitnessPal, but I do find the food app kind of strange in that it's really hard to find really basic things."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"Like I put in milk and you get, you know, milk chocolate and milk this, milk that, and you have to scroll down so far to find just regular old milk, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"But I guess – but what I do know and what I've already found is that, you know, once you get – because we're all pretty consistent on what we eat, I think, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"And so once you can get your customized stuff in there and use your recent or frequent, then it goes a lot faster."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"But, you know, because you can't – or I haven't – it doesn't appear that you can select –"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"Um, just kind of in my fitness pal, you can just check, check, check, check, you know, the stuff that you do frequently."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"And the other thing, and I, again, I'm sure you have a reason for doing this, but recording the exact time, given that you have to do that for every food, you can't just say, okay, you know, lunch and then enter the five."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,This is at this time and enter the 10 things or whatever.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,It's really a pain in the neck.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"you know, compared to other apps."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"But, like I said, I'm sure you have some reason for using that one and not one of the established ones."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,"Yeah, you know, of course, this is a research study, so we can't use, like, you know, a commercialized app."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"And there are so many entries in MyFitnessPal because since it is a commercial app, it lets people enter in their own items, and then that's available for everyone to use."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,"That's how, you know, they have such a large data"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,sure sure but that also makes it very inaccurate to be honest
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"the same item, but just based on how people entered it, it's all different."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,And the reason for the time is just that we wanted to be as accurate as we could when looking at data.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"Remember, you know, that re-randomization process is based on everything that you entered, so in order to make that most accurate to you, we need the most amount of data."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,"Sure, sure."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,"No, I understand."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,"I'm not really... I don't mean to complain, but it's just like it would be easier... I know you're not doing lunch, dinner, but given that you're entering..."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,usually you're eating a bunch of things at the same time.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,"It would be a whole lot easier if you could just enter the time of the meal and then enter everything and not have to re-enter the time every time, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,"And also, it's kind of, again, you know, if you enter, say, blueberries,"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,you get a million entries for everything processed with blueberries.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,"And then way at the bottom, it's raw blueberries."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"It's like, wouldn't raw blueberries be the first thing to come up?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,"Because those are real blueberries, you know, as opposed to processed food that has blueberries."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"You know, it's just kind of strange the way it works."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"Yeah, I definitely agree."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,"And, you know, we know that there's definitely limitations to our app."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,121,advisor,"But, again, we appreciate that you're being patient and, you know, still trying."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,"But, yeah, we know that there are definitely some things that could be improved."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,We can go ahead then and set up for our next call.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,"So if you could go ahead and then just move on to Lesson 2, that would be great."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,And then we can set our first SMART goal.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,So did you kind of have an idea of what you'd want your SMART goal to be?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,"Well, are they supposed to be..."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,"Weight-related or, I mean, we've got the goal of 10 pounds, I think, for this study, right?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,"So something toward that or it could be, well, let's see."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,"So it's supposed to be some behaviorally-based goal that you feel like you could work on from this week to next week that will help you, you know, achieve this overall goal of, you know, weight loss, healthy lifestyle, things like that."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,"So maybe to make sure that I've got physical activity in the range, at least in the range that was suggested, you know, six out of seven days."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,Does that seem reasonable?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,"Because I think, as I mentioned to you, since we moved, I don't have my exercise partner and"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,"It's not that easy finding the time to get the... You know, I do a certain amount of walking for my commute, but to get the more intensive level in just takes a little bit of planning."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,139,patient,"And, again, it's creating a new habit."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,140,patient,So I think that would be a good one.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,141,patient,Does that sound good?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,142,patient,"Yeah, definitely."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,145,patient,"And then for that call next week, what is a good day and time that you would like to talk?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,146,patient,Um...
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,147,patient,"Let's say at the same time next Wednesday, if I have any, because I can't entirely control my work calendar, if I should have something pop up on my work calendar that I can't change, if I have to, usually I would know that a few days in advance."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,148,patient,"But if I, even if it's the day before, can I, do you prefer email?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,149,patient,Do you prefer a call?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,150,patient,"Usually I would just have to say, you know, I can't do it at 9."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,151,patient,"Could we do it at 1 or, you know, between 1 and 4 or, you know, whatever."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,152,patient,Does that work for you?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,153,patient,Is email okay or do you prefer a call?
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,154,advisor,"Yeah, email would be fine."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,155,advisor,Just let me know.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,156,advisor,"Even if it's, you know, the morning of, that's okay with me."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,157,advisor,I'm always monitoring my email.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,158,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,159,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,160,patient,Terrific.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,161,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,162,advisor,"Well, then I will check in with you next week at 9."
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,163,patient,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,164,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,165,patient,Thank you so much.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,166,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w1.7.19.17.MD.MP3,167,patient,"Okay, bye-bye."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,So we are in week 10.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Lesson 10, mindfulness."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"Yes, yes."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,And what did you think of that one?
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,"I like that one because I really think that it's important for long-term success to, you know, follow some of the recommendations."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,I think it's so easy not to be thinking.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"It's so easy to mindlessly eat, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"And I do tend to be someone who eats fast, and I drink fast, too."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"And it means you're not really tasting your food, and you're not really so aware of when you're not hungry."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,And so...
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"I think, and I really tried to, you know, incorporate the recommendations this week."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"So, yeah, I thought it was helpful."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Yeah, and in trying to incorporate those recommendations, how did that go?"
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,It went well.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"You know, sometimes, you know, you look at that rather meager portion."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"It's kind of depressing, but if you eat slowly and you really enjoy the food more, number one, and you really don't need or want more usually, but if you plow through it too quickly, you just don't even know that."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"So, yeah, it's helpful and went well trying to incorporate that."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"And then your SMART goal, were you able to go to the gym at least once?"
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,um I do have a little bit of an excuse on that though just in the sense that we're doing this bathroom remodel so uh it's it's a little unusual but it really I mean every my exercise was down this week overall because every waking moment was that I wasn't at work was really spent shopping for all the little all the things that we need to shop for so um it's
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"but, you know, things are already better."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,So I have higher hopes for this week.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"So if you don't mind, I'm just going to keep the same goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Yes, I did see your physical activity was a little bit low this week."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Across six days, you did 234 minutes, so about maybe a workout or so shy of that 300."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"That was, yes, Saturday."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Usually I do a long workout, but instead..."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,We were running around.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"But like I say, that's already in the past, so this week is better."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"Yeah, but in terms of the diet and nutrition, everything still looks great."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Six days where you recorded at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,You met your calorie goal five of those days and your fat gram goal four of those days.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,And most recent weight I see is 182.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"So, yeah, it seems like even though, you know, you're going through this stressful period, you know, remodeling the bathroom, you're still able to keep on track with the diet portion."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"Did you find any difficulty trying to do that, or do you think it's just kind of habit now?"
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"No, it definitely has gotten easier."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"And I did have a couple of situations, you know, social situations, too, that required..."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"planning and kind of, and I do find, well, for instance, at the beginning, I had, was it the first week or so, I had one of the same social situations that came up, same people and everything, same situation, and I did not do well."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"This time, you know, remembering that and incorporating, you know, some of the things that"
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"I kind of thought it through, planned what I was going to do, what I was going to not do, you know, and it went much better."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"So, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"And then the other one was a new situation, but, you know, I kind of anticipated and kind of decided, okay, this is what I'm going to do."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,And I actually ate before I went there so that I wouldn't be hungry again.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,and I don't think I lost weight that day.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"In fact, I think that was the one day I gained a little, but then, but I really wasn't, I mean, it was not out of control at all."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"It was just, you know, so it was good."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"So I felt, I did feel good about that."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Yeah, definitely."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"You know, you should feel good about that, especially since you said, you know, in the beginning you had the very same social situation, which, you know, you felt like you could have improved upon, and this time, you know, you definitely did better, so that's awesome."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"You're still losing weight, so on my side, it's all good."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"Then let's see, for our next call, Lesson 11 is called Balance Your Thoughts."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"Then let's see, we have your SMART goal down, trying to go to the gym at least once before work."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"And then next Wednesday, that is going to be the 27th at 9."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"You know, right now I have something on my calendar that will make that impossible."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"I might not do it, but so I don't know if I either can get back to you or if we just want to set a different time maybe for later Wednesday at this point."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"Oh, yeah, we can just set a different time."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,That's fine.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,Do you want to say what works for you?
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,I'm free.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,From 11 to 3.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Oh, perfect."
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,You can do anything in there.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,How about 11.30?
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,So then I'll put you down next Wednesday the 27th at 11.30.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Thank you.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,You too.
Margaret/6048.F.w10.9.20.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so week 11, just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Lesson 11, balance your thoughts."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,What did you think of that one?
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,I thought it was good.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"I think, I mean, I wouldn't say I... I think I'm pretty good at not engaging in such negative thoughts as some of them that they, you know..."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"But still, it's helpful to keep in mind, helpful in helping get back on track if you, you know, have a bad episode."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Well, I guess that's, I shouldn't be saying bad episode, right?"
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,Even right there as an example.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"But yeah, no, I thought it was good, a reminder on how to reframe"
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"and kind of avoid the excuses and rationalizations and notice the positives, you know, notice the wins."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"So, yeah, I think it's helpful."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"And then your previous SMART goal, so you said you wanted to go to the gym at least once before work."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,Were you able to do that?
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,And I did.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,I did.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,I did.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"And it was really helpful because since I haven't done it, I didn't know."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"I mean, it took..."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,Three minutes to get to the gym from my car.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Wow, that's awesome."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"You know, during the weekend I might walk or ride my bicycle or something."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"But, you know, just because of time, you know, constraints, there's really, you know, you can get there very quickly."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,And I do love working out before work.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,It really jumpstarts the day.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"I feel good, you know, just more committed to healthy eating and lifestyle when I start that way."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"So there are just all kinds of reasons to, and I think it is important to get back into that habit before the bad weather because, you know, it just becomes more difficult to"
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"I always prefer being outside, but that's just not possible usually in a Chicago winter."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,So you have to have an alternative.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,So it was really good to break that barrier.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"Self-imposed, admittedly, but..."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"And then, yeah, looking at your data, another really great week."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"You recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days and met your calorie goal all seven days with meeting your fat gram goal six of those days."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Seven days of physical activity recorded, you did 382 minutes."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 181.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,So another pound down.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"So doing very, very well."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,How is this upcoming week looking?
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,It should be good.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"Yeah, it should be fine."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,I don't have any weddings or anything this weekend that might be challenging.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,I do kind of feel like I had days this week where I felt like I had done pretty well in terms of my calorie and fat goals.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,and yet I didn't see much drop-off in weight.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"So, you know, that's making me think I'm maybe going to, you know, I'm slowing down a bit, which is to be expected, I think."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"But, you know, like I say, I think you just have to plow through that because it does slow down after a while, and that's to be expected."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"So, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"So I think the reward, I think it's important to have other kinds of awards or rewards that you're thinking about, even if the scale isn't always showing what you hope it will, because you still know you're on the right path because you have that documentation, you know, within the app, you know, right?"
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"So you just think, well, okay, I stayed the same."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Or sometimes even, you know, you might even gain a couple ounces, but you know you've done what you were supposed to do, and you know that the results will be there if you persevere."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"So I think you then have to focus on, okay, I feel good."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,My clothes are feeling better.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"Hey, I can get into this thing that I wasn't able to get into before, you know, or whatever."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"And so you kind of reward yourself that way, even if the scale's not giving you that reward."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"So I think you get to a point where you have to come up with some new rewards, or else you can get a little bit discouraged."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"Yeah, like you had mentioned about Lesson 11, a lot of it really is about just reframing."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"Sometimes we're always stuck in kind of this very single-mindedness, but always looking towards other things."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"And in this situation, looking towards other achievements and accomplishments is always very helpful."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"Just how you feel, too, is another."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"So our last lesson is going to be number 12, weight loss plateau."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goals to be for the week?
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"I think maybe I'll keep it, you know, as another getting to the gym again before work because it's not exactly a habit yet."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"So, right, needs to become a habit, so."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Okay, and then for a call next week, does this time work?"
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"So next Wednesday, that's going to be the 4th at 1130, or did you want to move it to a different time?"
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,I think...
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"Yeah, let's keep it this time."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"My train seems to be pretty consistently late lately, so maybe this is less likely to have to reschedule if we just keep it this time."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Yeah, no problem."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"And then I just wanted to let you know, since our call next week is going to be our last one, and it will be a little bit longer, we just want to kind of talk about your experience so far and kind of what you should expect when this three-month is over, things like that, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"Okay, yeah, sounds good."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"Great, then I'll talk to you."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"Okay, thank you."
Margaret/6048.F.w11.9.27.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Bye.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so week 12, just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,Were you able to get to lesson 12?
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,And any thoughts about weight loss plateau or plateauing?
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"No, I mean, I think it's definitely good because it definitely happens."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,And I thought the strategies were helpful.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"So, yeah, that's it."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"I'm not quite there yet, I don't think."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"Right, right, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"So the reason why we kind of make that one, the last lesson is, you know, some people might have encountered a plateau during this 12-week period or so, but most people maybe now they might start encountering it."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"So, you know, just as kind of a final send-off, ways to deal with it, especially if it ever comes up, you know, especially in one year."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"If it's not going to come up now, it's definitely going to come up sometime."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"So, like you said, just some good things to keep in mind."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"Okay, and then how did your SMART goal go?"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,Not good.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"I didn't get to the gym this week, and I'm, well, you know, I think there's always a reason, right?"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"But I do, I am cutting myself a little bit of slack just because, really, I am living in a construction zone."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"And it's affecting, you know, sleep because there's all this dust in the house and, like, you know, if you have to get up in the middle of the night and use the bathroom, you have to go downstairs and, you know, I mean, it does."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"And so, and then I have, you know, had to be at work early, which, you know, trying to go in the morning, that affects."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"But, I mean, on the positive side, you know, I have been trying to add additional, like,"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"walked to, like if I, today I came in early on the early train, I walked to a further train stop, you know, L Station, so I've been getting out during lunchtime pretty faithfully, going for walks with my husband after dinner."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"So, you know, I have been still trying to, you know, get the exercise in, even if it's not in my preferred way."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"So, you know, but"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,I do think it's important to try to get back into that habit.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Definitely.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"All right, then let's see."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Looking at your goals, really great like always."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"So six days where you recorded at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,You met your calorie goal five of those days and then your fat gram goal four of those days.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,Seven days of physical activity.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"You did a total of 399 minutes, so you did meet your goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"And then most recent weight I see is 180, so another pound down from the last time we checked in."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Um, kind of at this point in time, you know, now that this initial period is over, how are you feeling about your progress?"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"I'm feeling very good, really good, and I get positive reinforcement because my clothes are fitting differently, so that's always really nice."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Yeah, awesome."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"kind of just wanted to check in on what you were thinking of doing, you know, now that the intervention, or at least this part of the intervention is finished."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"Were you thinking of tracking, things like that?"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"Yes, yes, absolutely."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"I'm going to, I have a Fitbit Flex at home, but it's one that they sent me when I lost the previous one, because those are terrible."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,You just lose them instantly.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,So I've lost
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,more than one.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,And I think I'll just lose this one.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,So I think I'm going to buy the zip because I like it better.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"And, um, it's not very expensive."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"And, um, uh, so I will continue with that."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Um, I haven't quite decided about the app yet because I have used like, you know, my fitness pal before, which I do prefer, um, because just, well, you know, it's well, it's,"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"It's, you know, even when was it last night, I was trying to find, you know, something, because I don't eat a lot of processed food, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"I really, and even though I'm overweight, my diet, when I'm counting calories, it's really not that different."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"It's really more a matter of portion control and dessert, because I do kind of like dessert, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"But aside from that, I don't eat processed food."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"So having to find, like, it's so frustrating to find, like, fresh food in that app."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"It's usually you have to scroll through, like, you know, I put in leek."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"And I come up with leek and potato soup, you know, 10 brands."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,So I think the other apps are better.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,So I probably will switch to a different app.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"But on the other hand, I don't like to mess with success."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,So I haven't really quite decided yet.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"Well, do you think it's more, you know, the tracking nature that's been helpful, or do you think it is the, you know, the goals that we set for you?"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"Well, I think the tracking is critical for me because it's really easy to underestimate her."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"And I find when I measure, you know, you would think, oh, I should be able to eyeball that bowl of cereal, you know, at this point."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"But what I find is if I don't measure, I eat less, you know, as I might eat more too, but I'm just as likely to eat less."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,And
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"I don't want to do that either, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,So measuring and kind of counting calories is important.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"The goals have been, you know, that's been good."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"It's good to have a goal, and I think it's good to weigh yourself every day."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"But for me, you know, it's kind of like an addict or something."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"If I go off the tracking, it's not good for me."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"But I have to say the other thing that is good for me, and I've kind of joked about, you know,"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"I don't know, what does this say about my relationship with authority or something, but knowing that, like, someone is watching, that's kind of good for me, too."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"But I've heard, I mean, I think you can do that differently."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"I mean, you can do that with your support network, too."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"Yes, and that's, oh, sorry, go ahead."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"No, no, no, that's okay."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"I mean, they're not, like, checking in."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"I mean, they're not, they can't watch what you're doing, but if you're kind of reporting progress to a buddy, you know..."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"then that's kind of another way to encourage each other and have someone else, you know, kind of knowing that it was a good week or wasn't or, you know, whatever."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,So I think that could be helpful as well.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"Yeah, and that is, you know, one thing that we do like to mention on these calls because, you know,"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"As you know, with these next few months, we are really interested to see what happens when an individual, you know, kind of goes off this very regulated plan, especially for someone like you who's receiving, you know, coaching calls."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,It's going to be very different.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,"Like you said, you're not going to have that same."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"you know, check-in that we do every week at the same time."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"However, you know, like you said, you still can do that, you know, with someone else or, you know, just check in with yourself once a week at the same time if you want to."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,Just go back and look at your progress.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,"You know, you can always do that."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,Sure.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,"And additionally, you know, you can set goals with yourself as well."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"So there are a lot of things, you know, that we do to help you, but it doesn't mean, you know, you can't do a lot of these things on your own as well."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,Sure.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,"Did you have any, like, questions about, you know, the intervention after this point or anything like that?"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"Well, yeah, I know I bring my stuff in, you know, when I come."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,And I know I got an email that has a survey that I need to fill out.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,I haven't really looked at that yet.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,So I guess I just have to do that before I come.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,And then I just come in and weigh myself.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,"Or you guys weigh me in, I don't know, you know, whatever else you do."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,And I don't know.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,Is there anything else I'm missing?
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,"Nope, that's pretty much it."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"You know, you will have access to the app for the full 12 months if you do want to use it."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,"And, you know, you can always, I think I mentioned this to you, you can, if you buy that zip, you can sync it up to our app."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,Everything will still.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,Still.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,So there's that.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,"If you ever feel the need to read the lessons ever again, you can do that as well."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"Oh, good."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,"Okay, so I'll still have access to the website?"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,"And, you know, although we're not doing coaching calls, if anything ever, you know, anything happens, you can always contact us."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,121,advisor,That's fine.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,"But otherwise, would you like to set one last SMART goal for yourself before that check-in?"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,"That check-in is the week after next, right?"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,"Well, I'd still like to, you know, get to the gym."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,We should be pretty much finished with this construction by early next week.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,"So I think I really do need to, you know, get into more of a habit."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,So I'm going to keep going with that.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,"Well then, I just wanted to say it has been an absolute pleasure talking to you, Anne."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,"Since you started in the intervention, you've lost 14 pounds, so that's really great."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,"We definitely know that this kind of intervention is not the easiest thing, and we always talk about it like, meet your goals, do this, do that, but we know that there's a lot involved in that process."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,"So I just wanted to wish you the best of luck with everything, and it's been great talking to you."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,132,patient,"Oh, great."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,"Well, thank you."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,"I've enjoyed it, and I'll miss you."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,"Yeah, but I appreciate it."
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,136,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,137,advisor,"Well, have a great week, and then we'll see you at your three-month assessment, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,139,patient,Sounds good.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,140,patient,Thanks.
Margaret/6048.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,141,patient,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are officially in week two of the study."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Like always, we'll be going over your lessons, SMART goal, your data and components."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"I asked you to read lesson two, healthy eating."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"Okay, and what did you think of that?"
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,I thought it was good.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,It was a good reminder.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"And then your SMART goal, you had said you want to do physical activity six out of the seven days."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,So I do see that.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,It's a really great job there.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Did you have to do anything in particular, you know, to kind of keep up that physical activity throughout the week?"
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"Yes, I did."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"And I, you know, just little small changes in habits happened."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"And it is a matter of habit, I think, for me very often and habits that I've had in the past, but then gradually they just, I don't know, something happens and I'm not doing them anymore."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"So, you know, things like I work at a university and I'm between campuses to some extent."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"So, you know, walking a couple of extra L stops, you know, not getting on at the closest one, but just if I have time, given that I often don't,"
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"take lunch, and so I don't have a chance to get out for a walk at lunchtime."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"You know, that kind of thing, just, you know, being aware of those opportunities, and I'm a really fast walker, so, you know, even if it's only 15 minutes, I feel like it's helping, you know, because I don't always have time for an hour or, you know, 45 minutes or whatever at a time."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"But, you know, I realized after we talked, I mean, I know that actually a lesser amount of physical activity, I think, was required this week, but what I really meant to say with that goal wasn't so much what I said, but what I really want to do is get back into the habit of getting out in the morning before I go to work, because I did have that habit for..."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,pretty consistently for almost 20 years.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"And then when we moved a year ago, and I don't have my exercise partner anymore."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"So that means my getting myself out, and that's really hard."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"But I'm a morning person, and I feel really good when I exercise first thing in the morning, whereas in the evening..."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"I just don't have energy, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"So that's really what I wanted to say, I think."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"And even if I were able to get out, I think if I have not gotten out once in the year that we've lived in the new house."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"And so even just getting out once in the next week to show me, you know, to remind myself how good I feel when I do that and that I like it and that it's not that bad, you know, especially, you know, it's summer, so it's light outside and everything."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,It would help me get back into that.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Um, great."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,We can go ahead and actually set that as your SMART goal if you'd like.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Um,"
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"you know, trying to exercise in the morning at least once, you know, before work."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Like you said, definitely reminding yourself of, you know, how good that makes you feel, all the positive benefits from that."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Hopefully we'll kind of kickstart something, but definitely understanding how hard it is to get started with those kinds of things."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"Yeah, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"And I think I have kind of another goal in mind, too, you know, based on the module this week, and that is just to..."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,up my vegetable quantity and variety a little bit.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,My husband does most of the cooking because he's retired.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,And he gets a little bit lazy sometimes.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"You know, he kind of runs out of steam."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"But really, there's no reason why I can't do that part of it"
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"You know, when I get home or there are other things I can do, like, you know, make a really good veggie soup that I could have, you know, some, you know, I can have some at dinner or whatever kind of takes the edge off hunger, puts the vegetables in the equation."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"And it's really not that hard to do for me to make a big batch of that, you know, on the weekend or something to have, so."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,So that's kind of another thing I have in mind.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"I eat a lot of fruit, so that's not really an issue."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"And I probably under-report my vegetables a little bit because honestly, like last night, I had all this red pepper with my chicken and tortilla, so it was kind of like a little fajita, but"
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"I could not find in the app, this is not the first time I've had red pepper several times, there is no raw red pepper."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Not raw, but like something other than bottled or, you know, roasted red pepper hummus or whatever."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,You just cannot find red pepper.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,It's like that app is made for people who eat out and eat fast food and eat processed food.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"For those of us, because really, I do not eat a lot of processed food."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"And we, my husband and I cook, and we use, you know, fresh food and vegetables and stuff, and it's kind of low on, it's really kind of hard to find those fresh options sometimes."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"Are you looking for, like, a red bell pepper?"
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,Is that what you're looking for?
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"Okay, that's weird."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,That should definitely.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"Yeah, I couldn't find it."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,I've looked a couple of times.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,So I just didn't enter it because I just got kind of frustrated.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"Right, which is understandable."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"But anyway, I don't want to complain about the app."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"No, please complain about the app."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"The more complaints we have, the better that we can make it for other people."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"So if I type in bell pepper and you scroll down a little bit, it'll have, like, red, yellow, and green."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"Okay, okay."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"So I was just putting in red pepper, then I tried red bell pepper, then I tried green pepper."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"I guess I didn't think about, and then I think I tried yellow pepper, and then I didn't think of just trying bell pepper."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Yeah, I know we tell you to be, like, as specific as possible, but then, you know, sometimes you don't."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"So, yeah, I totally understand, you know, the frustration."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"Again, just trying your best, and it's okay if you're under-reporting a little bit."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"Just not, you know, too much because you don't want to cheat yourself in terms of that calorie goal, but, you know, bell pepper isn't going to make too much of a difference."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,No.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"Well, that's the calculation I made."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"You know, well, it's not very many calories in celery or something, so I'm not going to worry about it too much."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Exactly.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"Okay, so I can go ahead then and go over the rest of your data."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"So since the last time we talked, so that was the 19th until yesterday, the 25th, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days, so really great job there."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"Looks like you met your calorie goal five of those days and your fat gram goal four of those days, so doing a pretty good job with the calories and fat grams."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"Physical activity, all seven days recorded a total of 390 minutes, so blew past your goal there."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,"And then most recent weight I see is 191, is that correct?"
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"Okay, so that's two pounds down from the last time we checked in, so right within kind of our..."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"zone of how much we want you to lose a week, so doing a really great job overall."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,Everything is looking really great.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,Is there anything that you wanted to bring up about your data or any questions you have?
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"No, just that I don't think my husband has worked on the scale anymore, but I'll try to get him to – I think it is probably that SSID number."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,I don't know if we're really going to try very hard to change that.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,We're just worried about the consequences.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"So when we talk next week, maybe we can talk about whether I should bring that back to you."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,"My daughter actually is doing an internship at Lori Children's, and she's in your building over there."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,So I could easily have her return it to the front desk or something.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,um or i could come myself so actually you know um even you can use do you have a scale at home other than the yeah yeah that's what i've been using it so um you know you have to come into that three-month assessment anyway so we don't want to make another trip down there so you can just wait to bring it back then um it's really not a big deal for us okay okay that's fine
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,"Okay, then we can go ahead and set up for our next call."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,So please go ahead and read lesson three.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,That one is called adding activity to your day.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,"So far, you know, it looks like you're doing very well with that, but maybe this might give you some inspiration for some other ideas."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,And then we have your smart goal down.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"Okay, then we can go ahead and set up a time to talk next week."
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,"So if this day and time generally works for you,"
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,Wednesday at 9?
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,"Then I will check in with you then, and have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,Thanks.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,You too.
Margaret/6048.F.w2.7.26.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,Thanks.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,We are officially in week three.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,"For this call, I asked you to read lesson three, adding activity to your day."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,And what did you think of that one?
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Oh, yeah, it was good."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,And let's see your SMART goals.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"So also related to physical activity, you wanted to make sure that you exercised in the morning at least once before work."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,So how did that work?
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"Well, I did go once, and it felt great."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"It's not that hard, so I plan to do it again tomorrow."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,Glad to hear that you're getting that in.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"I know that that was something that you were really focused on, and you're doing very well in terms of physical activity."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"Last week, I saw six days recorded."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"You did a total of 340 minutes, so definitely met that 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"You know, really impressed."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,I know that that goal is not easy to meet.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"And not only did you meet it, you also went beyond that."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,So really great job there.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,And the diet component is great as well.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"All seven days you recorded at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,And you met your calorie goal five of those days and your fat gram goal four of those days.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Kind of at this point, how are you feeling about meeting the goals?"
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,Pretty good.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"I mean, I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"I did have two bad days, you know, in terms of not meeting my calorie goals."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"But, you know, I got back on track right away, so that's good."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,So that's what I have to kind of focus on.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Yes, and that getting back on track, you know, is very important."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"I think early on, especially, it's important to realize that there are just going to be days where you do go over that calorie goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"It's just, you know, that's just what's going to happen."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"It's not a big deal if you go over it one day, just as long as you, like you said, pick yourself back up, kind of remind yourself, you know, that you're in the study, you have a goal in mind, and trying to stick to those goals."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 190.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"I thought it was today, was it 190.8?"
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"Oh, it is probably, you know, point something."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, sure."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Yeah, so from the last time you checked in, that's a one pound down, so right at that level that we like to see."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,So everything is going really great.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,How is this upcoming week looking for you?
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"Good, good, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"No, no."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"Yeah, so I think that's good."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"Yeah, then you can just kind of keep going, keep doing what you're doing, right?"
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Yeah, that's the goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,That's the hope.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"Then if you could go ahead and read Lesson 4, that would be great."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,I would like to...
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,to put it out there as a goal.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"I did do strength training, but so far only, I mean, I did it on Sunday, was it?"
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"So I really, I mean, in order for that to be effective, you really need to be pretty consistent doing three days a week."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"And of course, you don't have to be at the gym because you can do, you know, sort of body weight resistance"
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"So there's really no excuse not to, but historically that's been really good for me."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"And again, it's another thing that kind of fell by the wayside during and after the move, the move from hell."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,So I would like to consistently be doing that like three days a week.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Anyway.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"So I'd like to say, you know, get three days in this coming week would be good."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"And then for our call next week, so if we do same day and time, next Wednesday is the 9th at 9 a.m."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,Is that okay?
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"It should be, yes."
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Keep up the great work, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6048.F.w3.8.2.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week four."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"We'll be going over our usual agenda today, so going over that lesson, talking about your SMART goal, and then going over all your data."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Lesson four was called Making Smart Food Choices.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"Any big takeaways from that lesson, or did you learn anything new?"
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Well, it's always really good to..."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"be reminded about restaurant eating, which is always, you know, difficult or can be."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"So, yeah, I always, you know, I'm not sure anything is entirely new, but you need the reminders, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,So it was good.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"And then for your previous SMART goals, so you said you wanted to do some strength training at home at least three times a week."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,So how did that work?
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"Well, I did two."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,I didn't do three.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"But, you know, better than one."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"Right, exactly."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"I think two is about the minimum that you can really make a little progress, but three is better."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,And kind of what was your barrier to get that third time?
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,Was it just you were busy or kind of what happened there?
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"You know, yeah, I mean..."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"Sometimes by the time I finish my other, the more aerobic exercise, then I sort of run out of steam."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"And I really need to just... And I'm really a morning person, you know, saying, oh, I'll do some other things and then I'll do it later, just does not work."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"So again, it's really kind of a matter of habit and starting the habit and then..."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,you know keep maintaining the habit once you've got the habit going then it flows so so anyway that's my experience anyway okay great all right then looking at your data another very good week so i saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories six out of the seven days and then you met your calorie and fat gram goal all six of those days so really great job there
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Physical activity, great as well."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Over the course of seven days, I saw a total of 346 minutes, so you did meet your 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"And then most recent weight is 189, is that correct?"
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"Okay, yep, so that is another pound down from the last time we checked in, so, you know, you're being very consistent with that weight loss, at least a pound a week."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"You make these calls very easy and very short, but is there anything, you know, that you want to talk about, anything like that?"
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Um...
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"No, I think, I mean, I'm getting used to the app or I'm pretty used to the app now and have got my times."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"The one day I didn't enter stuff, you know, it really helps to do it pretty much right away."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"And for me, if I don't enter it, that can be a danger sign, too, that I don't want to enter it because I've been a little bit..."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,I know I've maybe gone over my goals.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"I'm much more likely to be on track when I'm right there, right up to date."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,One of the challenges for me is spreading things out because I tend not to be that hungry earlier in the day.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,I always eat breakfast.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"I'm definitely a breakfast eater, but, you know, you could put a donut in front of me at this time of the day, and I don't have any problem saying no to it."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"Three o'clock, another story."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"You know, that's when I want a cookie or something."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"So I tend to kind of save calories for later in the day, and a couple days this week, I really had too many calories and fat left at the end of the day."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,I was kind of
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"you know, like, oh gosh, what am I going to eat?"
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Because I knew I'd be, I was afraid I'd be hungry if I didn't eat something, but so, you know, it's kind of getting that rhythm right, and I'm not quite there yet, but I'm always, I don't want to be hungry either, you know, so it makes sense for me to"
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,I know it's good to eat more early in the day and less later in the day.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"But for me, I'm much more tempted later in the day."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,So it's good for me to have a little cushion there.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"So I don't like to feel deprived or overly hungry because that's when I might get into trouble, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,So anyway.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,That's kind of what I've been thinking about this week.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"I think, you know, generally we don't want you to feel deprived either, of course."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"Finding a good middle ground, like you said, you know, just, you know, spacing out where you want to eat and just kind of being, you know, having an overall awareness, you know, is always good."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,So everything looks good on my end.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"So for our next call, if you could just go ahead and read the next lesson, lesson five."
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Sure.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"Well, can I say, again, my weight training?"
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,Three times a week?
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"And then, let's see, next week, the 16th at 9, is that going to be okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6048.F.w4.8.9.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,Bye bye.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,So we are in week five.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Lesson five, navigating social cues, gatherings, and holidays."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,And what did you think of that lesson?
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,It was good.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"Yeah, those are always difficult times, holidays and social gatherings where there's lots of excessive food and drink."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Do you have any big social engagements coming up in the near future?
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"No, not in the near future."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,And nothing that kind of fits that category that they were talking about.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"But certainly navigating the holidays is something that, you know, we all have experience with."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,And you definitely need a plan.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"And I think that's one of the takeaways from that lesson is whether it's a gathering, you know, at a private home or restaurant or the holidays or whatever, you really need to plan for it."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"Your previous SMARCLE, you had said you wanted to do the strength training at home three times a week."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,So how did that go?
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Well, I'm on pace to do three."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"So, you know, I did Saturday, yesterday."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,I didn't enter that one yet.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"In fact, I kind of forgot how to enter the sort of activity that's not picked up."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,So I have some strength training in the past that I didn't enter.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,But then I...
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,look at the documentation and remember how to do it.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,So I'm back doing that.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,I was going to tell you how to do it.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"It's so easy, but I was getting confused about whether I entered that on the Fitbit or the app."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,So...
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Anyway.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"Yeah, it's, you know, there's a lot to remember, so I don't need to, but I'm glad to hear that you're on track for that."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"And looking at your other data, everything was really great this past week."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"So I'm looking at, from the last time we talked, August 9th until yesterday, August 15th."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Over this seven-day period, you did record at least 1,000 calories all seven days, and you met your calorie goal all seven days, so really, really great job there."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,fat gram goal you met those five days so again physical activity really great as well six days entered you did a total of 382 minutes so you did meet that 300 minute goal and then most recent weight i see is 188 is that correct yep yep so that is another pound down from the last time we checked in so we are you know you are right on track for losing that one pound a week which
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,is great.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"Have you started to notice any, like, physical changes in terms of, you know, like, more energy, things like that?"
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,Absolutely.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"And even my clothes are fitting a little bit better, and so absolutely, I feel good."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"And it, you know, kind of gets easier because it's self-reinforcing."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"And, you know, that one day, I did wear the tracker that day, but I think I never synced it somehow."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"That one day, that Monday, I think it was a Monday, that it recorded no activity."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"I don't know what happened with that because I wore the tracker all day, but maybe I just never, it never was synced somehow with the app."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,It might have been because the Fitbit keeps track of a certain intensity of physical activity that you're doing.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Do you feel like, you know... No, it was just a regular day."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,Oh.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"Yeah, that's strange, but it looks like it's all coming through now, so... Yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"You know, maybe it was just that one day there was a glitch in the system or something like that."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"Yeah, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Anyway, that's fine."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"It doesn't matter, but... Yeah, okay."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"For our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 6."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,That one is called Ways to Stay Motivated.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"So on that next call, we will officially be at the halfway point for kind of this first part of the study."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"So I kind of want to reassess, you know, how you're feeling about your motivation, your progress, things like that, and we'll talk about that a little bit."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for this week?
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Um...
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,I think I would like to get to the gym more because the intensity of the workout is greater there.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"And I think the higher intensity workout seems, for me at least, I don't know what the science is on it, but"
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,it seems to have a greater impact or it seems to be sort of necessary for greater overall fitness.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"Yeah, you're definitely right there."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"With anything, your body gets used to a certain intensity of physical activity, so you always kind of have to bump it up a little bit."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Okay, we can set that."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"And then for our call next week, so next Wednesday is the 23rd, and that would be at 9."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"It should be, yeah, and I'll reach out."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"If it's not, I'll try to do it earlier."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"Oh, no, it's okay."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"I'm always looking at my emails, so it's not a big deal."
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6048.F.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are officially in week six of the study."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"So right at that halfway point of this first part, just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Lesson six was called Ways to Stay Motivated.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"You know, actually, I just, as I picked up the phone, I thought, oh, shoot."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I did not.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I did not.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,Sorry about that.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,It's OK.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,I just want to kind of talk about motivation in general then.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Kind of just want to check in on how you're feeling, you know, about your own motivation and your progress."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"You know, pretty good."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"Yeah, I definitely don't feel, you know, like I'm going to stop doing this or anything or slack off or, you know, anything like that."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"So, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"We were out to dinner Sunday, and I did very well navigating the restaurant menu, so I felt good about that."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"And I read an interesting article this week, too."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"It was about something about if it's about willpower, you know, willpower doesn't really last."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,it has to really be coming from a sort of deeper commitment.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"So I thought that was sort of, if that makes sense."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Yes, yes, definitely."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"If it's a deeper commitment, then you're not, you know, you're not ever having to think about it that much."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Right, right."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"You know, that's where that motivation comes into play."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"Right, right."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"So anyway, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"And talking about, let's see, your weight progress."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,So today I see you're at 187.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,So that's another pound down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"So, so far you've been very consistent, losing about one pound a week."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"So you're, you've lost six pounds so far."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,So right where we want you to be.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,How are you feeling about your progress so far?
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Good, good, very good."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"All right, then let's see your previous SMART goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,You said you wanted to get to the gym more.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,How did that go this past week?
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Well, I still only got there once."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,What was kind of your biggest barrier to getting there?
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"Well, you know, it's just the same old thing."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"After work, I'm just, I'm tired."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,I'm a morning person.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"So if I don't get there in the morning, then, but you know, like today I left the house at 7.05."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"So to add the gym in as well, you know, that's really pretty difficult to do."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"But I have been, I mean, on the plus side, I have been walking more consistently at lunchtime."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"So, you know, and I'm a fast walker, so I definitely break a sweat doing that."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"And even, you know, I was on the early train this morning, so I didn't go to the most, to the closest train stop."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,I walked a couple stops down.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"Um, so just trying to incorporate, um, you know, more exercise when I can."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Um, I'd still like to get to the gym more often because I, the intensity of the workout is greater at the gym, but, um, but I just have to figure out how I'm going to do that."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"Because the other thing is like, I could have gone on Sunday this week, but"
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"I like, when it's a nice day, I really like being outside, too."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"You know, so, yeah, I could have gone to the gym, but instead I took, you know, like a four-mile walk outside."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"So, I don't know."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,It's a little bit of a dilemma.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"I really, you know, if I didn't have this darn full-time day job, it would be a lot easier."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,And I don't have...
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"I wish I had, I mean, technically I should have the flexibility to maybe start an hour later or something."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"I mean, my employer has that kind of flexibility, but my boss tends not to be like that kind of arrangement."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"So that would be, you know, maybe another possibly something to look at long-term, though, to kind of work."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"a different, like, 10 to 6 type of schedule, you know, since I am a morning person and I'm not really likely to go to the gym at night."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"So, I don't know."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,It's kind of a bigger issue.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"But anyway, I did feel like even my gym workout, I see such a difference."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,It's amazing what six weeks difference makes in being diligent about the exercise and the diet.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,I really feel like I'm doing a lot better at the gym.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,So that's good.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"Yeah, I mean, despite, you know, not going to the gym, it still looks like you're doing physical activity very consistently."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"You know, I saw all seven days there was something recorded you did 410 minutes."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,So you're still meeting that goal.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"And, you know, you are correct at the gym, you're probably going to get a more intense workout."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"But, you know, you also have to do something that's going to fit into your lifestyle."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"You don't want to, you know, just change everything just for the sake of"
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"I feel like until we run into a big problem getting in that physical activity, I wouldn't really be too worried about it."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Yeah, the winter could be a big problem."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"That's true, that's true."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"But for now, it seems like everything is going just fine."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"Yeah, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"Okay, let's see then."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,The rest of your data looks good as well.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"I saw all seven days you recorded at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,It looks like you met your calorie and fat gram goal four of those days.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,So doing pretty well.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"The days that you didn't meet the goal, you know, you were right basically at that 1500."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,"I saw 1516, 1513."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,So doing fine there.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,Is there anything that you want to bring up about the past week or anything that you wanted to talk about on this call?
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"No, I did."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"I was happy with, you know, what I did at that restaurant, as I say."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"And, you know, people were eating much worse things around me."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,So that was good.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"I kept focusing on that commitment idea rather than just willpower, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"So, no, I mean, I feel like I'm in a pretty good place right now."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,"All right, then, let's see, our next lesson."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,So if you could just go ahead and read 6 and 7 for me.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"Yes, I will."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,"7 is pretty brief, so I don't think that should be too bad."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,And then what would you like that smart goal to be?
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,"I think I need to, some of those days where I may have gone over a little bit,"
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,"I probably wouldn't have, but, you know, my husband does the cooking, and sometimes he runs out of steam."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,So he'll stop at kind of the vegetable salad area.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,"So I think I need to, you know, wash a whole bunch of lettuce a couple times a week and just have it in the fridge so it's easier to..."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,"just add to it or, you know, make a vegetable soup or something that I can just eat when I'm hungry."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,"Because sometimes if he, you know, sort of runs out of steam, that's when I might eat more of some of the higher calorie items."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,And I wouldn't if there was some other option.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,"But at that point, I'm too tired or lazy to make it myself."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,"So I think I need to maybe do a little bit, like, prep myself when I have time, you know?"
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,"Yeah, definitely."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,"Yeah, just having some, you know, foods on hand."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,"Even if it's just a snack, it doesn't have to be a whole meal, something that you can turn to."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,Sounds good.
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,"Okay, then let's see."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,"Next Wednesday, that is going to be August 30th at 9."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,Is that okay?
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"Yeah, that should be fine."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"Okay, thank you."
Margaret/6048.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,I understand that.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Week seven, just to remind you, like always, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,So we'll just be going over our regular agenda today.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,Sure.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"Lessons six and seven, were you able to get to those?"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Yes, I did."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,And I even printed those because they are good ones to sort of keep handy.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"especially this week, because I did have a couple of slips this week."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"Yeah, do you mind telling me a little bit about that?"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,Sure.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"Yeah, over the weekend, we had just a lot of social activity."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"So there was, you know, stuff that I couldn't control entirely."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,We were invited for breakfast at some
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"neighbors who are in their mid-80s, and they were all pleased with themselves."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,They had made three different kinds of waffles.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Oh, wow."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"And, I mean, you had to eat some of each, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"Then they brought out these, like, homemade muffins, the kind that had probably, you know, 800 calories in them."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"So, you know, I tried to control portion, but"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"And then we had another social event that night, and, you know, I couldn't, you know, just pizza put in front of me with not a lot of other choices."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"So, again, you can control portion, but you're hungry, you know, so that's... So, anyway, so I had two bad days in a row, but I really got back on track right away."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"So, you know, I mean, that was the good thing, but I thought the lesson was good in..."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"I probably didn't have enough of a plan ahead of time, although sometimes when you're in someone's home, you don't know exactly what to expect because you don't know what they're going to serve or how they're going to serve it and what the situation is."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"So anyway, that was my week."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Yeah, so it does sound like that was a particularly difficult situation."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"You know, I definitely understand that social pressure to eat those foods and, you know, just engage socially and eating is definitely a part of that."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Do you feel like even though, you know, you felt like you had to eat those foods, you kind of kept your portion size in check?"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"I tried to, yes, I did try to, and I tried to, you know, use,"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"no, you know, butter and a minimum amount of syrup, you know, but, yeah, I mean, they poured, you know, big glasses of orange juice, which I don't, I never drink orange juice."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"I know how many calories and how much sugar is in orange juice, so I never drink that, but, you know, so it was just one of those awkward things, but..."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"So yeah, I did okay on that."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"I mean, on what I could control, but I think I could have done better in some cases."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Yeah, so I think we mentioned this a little bit before, but there are going to be some situations where you just can't avoid that it is what it is."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"And I know that the lesson does talk about picking yourself back up, realizing that you kind of have"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"A new day, and just because you slipped up once doesn't mean, you know, you have to continue down on this slide."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"So do you feel like, you know, even though you had that particularly, you know, filling and heavy breakfast, that you kind of were able to bounce back and stick back to your goals?"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,Or do you feel like it's kind of been continuing down this slide?
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"No, no."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"I had, like I say, a couple of days of a lot of social activity where I couldn't control what was put in front of me."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,And...
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"No, and I got immediately back on track once I was back in control."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Was the food good at least?
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Yes, it was."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,That's good.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Then it's, you know, it is worth it once in a while, I think."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"You know, we usually tell participants it's just unreasonable to think that you're going to be, you know, on top of your goals 24-7."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"So, you know, sometimes having those foods kind of..."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"you know, I guess resets you in a way and you're kind of ready to get back on track after that."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"So, you know, that's what's important."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"Let's see, looking at your SMART goals, so you had said you wanted to meal prep."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,How did that go?
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"It went pretty well because, yeah, someone gave us a bunch of fresh vegetables from their backyard."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,So we've really been
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,We've had a very healthy dinner this week each day.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"So, yeah, I mean, I did spend a little bit more time than I usually do and kind of also coached my husband because, you know, he does most of the cooking."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"So I have to kind of, and he doesn't tend to follow recipes often,"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"So I just have to, you know, remind him, hey, you know, we're going to grill those vegetables, yeah, we're going to put some olive oil on them, but let's, you know, we don't, let's measure it and let's not overdo it."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"You only need a little, you know, that kind of stuff."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"So, yeah, I mean, between us, I think we've,"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,We've done pretty well.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"All right, then let me just go ahead and go over your data really briefly."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"So over this past week, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Out of those seven days, you met your calorie goal three of those days and your fat gram goal four of those days."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,So not too bad there.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Physical activity all seven days, something has been entered."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"You did 387 minutes, so you did meet your 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 186 this morning.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"I threw my bad weekend and then getting back on track, I've seen some wild fluctuations."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"I mean, it's really interesting."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"So I, you know, shot up."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"for a couple days, and then I was really stunned this morning at how low it was."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,So I don't know.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,We'll see.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"I suspect I'll kind of plateau now a little bit, you know, and I'm going to check the battery and that scale too because, I don't know, it's always in the right direction, so I trust it in that way."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"I mean, it's in the direction I expect, put it that way."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,But sometimes the fluctuation from day to day is more than I would expect.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"So then I wonder about the scale, you know?"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,I feel like some people have mentioned that.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,"Generally what we tell participants is, you know, those kind of wild fluctuations are actually pretty normal, especially..."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"Um, you know, you have been eating a particular way for a while and then all of a sudden you have this like very calorie heavy meal."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,Your body's really going to store that.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"Um, but it's also going to get rid of that pretty quickly once you get back on track, which is kind of why you might be seeing this big fluctuation."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,"Also, you know, if you were eating like salty foods, your body's going to retain water."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"So that's going to add on fluctuation, things like that."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"Um, you seem to be doing..."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"maintaining, you know, your goals, sticking to those."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"So I don't think we're going to hit a plateau quite yet, especially you've been very consistent with physical activity, which is pretty important there."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,"So, you know, if you do, a plateau is very normal."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,We'll discuss it when it happens.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,"But it seems, you know, you're still losing weight."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,You're a pound down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,So everything looks good.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,Done.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,Is there anything that you wanted to talk about or bring up on this call?
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,Any questions you have?
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,"No, it was the lesson this week was, you know, just exactly what I needed."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,So that was good.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,"And the previous one about staying motivated was good, too, because I was so confident about that last week."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,"And then I had, you know, a couple of bad days."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,So it was sort of good to...
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,"kind of be humbled in that way that you have to be vigilant, you know, so."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,"Yeah, I'm glad, you know, you found some lessons that were relevant to you."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,"I know a lot of people talk about how most of these are kind of review, but once in a while, you know, there's something that sticks with you, so I'm glad that you found something for you."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"Okay, then the next lesson is going to be number eight."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,That one is called Food Cravings and Cues.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for this week?
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"Well, I have a four-day weekend this weekend, so I would like to say that I want to make sure that I, you know, get some substantial and varied exercise in."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,"I already know I'm going to be walking with my friend, who I can't walk with as much as I used to."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,"One morning, I'd like to bicycle."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,"One morning, get to the gym."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,"You know, so that's four days for walking."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,"you know, varied activities I would like to see, I think."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,"And then, let's see, next Wednesday, that is going to be the 6th at 9, or excuse me,"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,128,patient,"Oh, you know what?"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,"Yes, yes, it is."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,"I had something the day before at 9, but, yeah, that should be fine."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,"You know, if anything ever comes up, just feel free to shoot me an email."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,Sure.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,134,advisor,"All right, then I will talk to you next week."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,135,advisor,"Have a great weekend, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,"Yes, thank you."
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,You too.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6048.F.w7.8.30.17.MD.MP3,139,patient,"Okay, bye-bye."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,We are in week eight.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Lesson eight, that was food cravings and cues."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to this one?
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,Any big takeaways or did you like anything that you read or did you relate to anything?
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Yeah, absolutely."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"Yeah, I think it was timely sort of over the holiday weekend, too, because, you know, sort of end of the summer barbecues."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"One of my... One thing that I really have difficulty with, if there are any potato chips around, I really have a hard time not picking out on those."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,And so...
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"You know, kind of remembering that anything, you can really have anything."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,You just need to modify the portion or control the portion.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"And, you know, I think when you crave something, it's maybe better to have some and just control the portion rather than make it into this big thing in your mind and then you're kind of out of control, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"So, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"that's generally what we tell participants, you know, controlling that portion size is usually the best way to go about it, so really great."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,Do you feel like you were able to do that over this holiday weekend?
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"I did indulge in a few different things, and so I did go over my fat and calories, and I saw it in my weight fluctuation, but it wasn't, I mean, it definitely was, you know, like some flips, not slides, and"
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"Um, you know, it wasn't, um, like, you know, really, really bad."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"So, and, you know, when I go to the movies, for instance, you know, I really love movie popcorn."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Um, so I did have some this weekend, but it's definitely sort of a guilty pleasure because I like it with butter, you know?"
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"So, um..."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Uh, so again, but if I had been organized, I also know that if I bring a bag of that Skinny Pop, you know, small bag, that really satisfies me, but I have to plan for it."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"So again, you know, it's all about planning and anticipating because I'm fairly, um, consistent in my, the things that I have trouble with, you know?"
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"And I can identify the kinds of situations, the time of day even, you know, much more likely to not be able to control the craving if it's like late afternoon."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Morning, not really a problem for me, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"So, you know, you just kind of know yourself."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,And then plan.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,And then sometimes indulge.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"but hopefully in a controlled way, you know?"
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"Yeah, exactly."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"All right, then let's see, your previous SMART goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"So you did have a long weekend, so you said you wanted to make sure that you were getting some different types of physical activity in, so, you know, bicycling, going to the gym, things like that."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,Get back!
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,It went well.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"I mean, I went to the gym."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"I did a really long walk with my friend, although that was the first time ever I've forgotten."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Like, I got up in the morning and did not put the Fitbit on."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Oh, no."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"Yeah, I had to enter that manually."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"I got to the gym twice, so, you know, that was good."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"I was going to go on my bicycle, but unfortunately then it rained."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"So I didn't do that, but still I felt good about the activity level."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"And the variety was pretty good, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"All right, then let's look at your data."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"So, yes, physical activity was really great."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"Across seven days you did 455 minutes total, so definitely past that 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Uh, the diet portion was great as well."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Seven days where you record at least a thousand calories.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"You met your goal six of those days, uh, and your fat gram goal five of those days."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"So even despite, you know, the holiday weekend, it still looked like you were able to stay on track."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"Um, and you're right."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,There is a little bit of fluctuation with your weight.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"Um, however it looks like today, you know, you're at 185."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"So, uh, that is a pound down from the last time we checked in."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"So, um, everything is still looking good."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,How is this upcoming week looking?
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,Just normal or anything going on?
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"No, this is a normal week."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,Is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or anything that you wanted to talk about?
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"No, I don't think so."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,I don't think so.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"Then for our next call, the next lesson, number nine, is called Stress Management."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"So just kind of talk about, you know, pretty self-explanatory stress, how to deal with it, things like that."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be?
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,Hmm.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Well, let's focus on the activity level again because we're starting a bathroom remodel on next Monday."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"And, you know, showing that wedge between the shopping we have to do in the next week and the disruption that that's going to cause in our lives for a few weeks, I think it's going to be, you know, I'm going to have to be even more kind of dedicated to make sure I get the exercise in."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"So let's say, you know, six out of the seven days, you know, I've been looking at that, you know, 10,000 steps and a couple times with the gym, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,I'd like to make sure I get that all in.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"And then let's see, next Wednesday, that is going to be the 13th at 9."
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,Is that going to be okay for now?
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,I think so.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,Let me just check my calendar real quick here.
Margaret/6048.F.w8.9.6.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"Yeah, that looks fine."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,We are in week nine.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Lesson nine, stress management."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,What did you think of that lesson?
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,4,unknown,"Oh, it was good."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,5,unknown,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,6,unknown,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,Do you feel like stress affects your ability to engage in healthy behaviors at all?
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Yes, I think it can, although I am sort of aware of that."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"You know, I will catch myself going for the cookies when it's really a stress thing, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"So, and I think when you catch yourself or when you're aware of it, then you can do something about it."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"It's sort of when you're not aware that you might, you know, you've done damage before, it's too late, you know, and then suddenly it's, you know, sort of too late, so..."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"So, yeah, and I think for me, I know that, you know, I don't like interpersonal conflict."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"So any sort of conflict, that could be, you know, a trigger for me."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"But as I say, I am aware of it, so that's good."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"And then, let's see, your previous SMART goals, you had said you wanted to do your 10,000 steps and hit that 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,So looking at your physical activity this past week was really great.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"Across seven days you did 486 minutes, so really great job there."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"And generally most of the days you did hit either 10,000 steps or more, so really great."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Yeah, I think one day Friday I didn't, but that was it, yeah."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"So, yeah, yeah, I did feel good about that, and it wasn't."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"It really, you know, what's helping me is just finding little wedges of time where I can do, you know, sort of a 20-minute power walk, you know, like at lunchtime or, you know, that kind of thing."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,So that's good.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,25,unknown,That's good.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"uh, the diet portion looked really great as well."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Uh, you record at least a thousand calories all seven days."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,You met your calorie and fat gram goal five of those days.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 183.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"Um, but I, as I mentioned before, the scale's bouncing around a lot and, um, you know, I don't want to buy a new scale at this point, given that healthy we are."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Um,"
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"But, like, this morning I weighed myself three times, and I got three different weights before I had had anything to drink."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,But it's always correct directionally.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,So it just kind of bounces around.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,So I take the highest that it gives me.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Okay, wow."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"So, I mean, so I think I got, you know, I was within, like, eight ounces today."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"three different weights within eight ounces, and I took the highest of the three."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"I mean, it is a machine, so it is bound to make mistakes."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,It's the digital kind.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,I kind of feel like they might be a little bit less accurate than...
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"the old-fashioned weight times, you know?"
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Yeah, so if that is, you know, the highest weight, then that means you have actually officially met your weight loss goal for this study, so congratulations."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Your weight goal was 184, and so, you know, you're already surpassed that, so that's really great."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"I know that we have about one month left with these coaching calls, so kind of for the rest of this time, how did you want to proceed?"
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Are you still interested in losing weight, or"
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"Oh, no, no."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Gosh, I definitely want to."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,I still have more to lose for sure.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Although I have to say that given that I have, you know, lost weight before and then gained it back, I could really use a study in maintaining."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"So you guys should, you know, think about..."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,people like me who have a yo-yo history and how to stop that pattern.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"That's actually definitely something we can probably talk about on our last call since, you know, even though for these first three months, you know, you do have all these components, you are in the study for a year, so we kind of are interested in what happens after this kind of initial period."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"So definitely something we'll talk about on that last call, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,63,unknown,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,64,unknown,Sounds good.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"Then for our call next week, lesson 10 is called Mindfulness."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,67,unknown,So if you just listen to that.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,69,unknown,"Oh, gosh."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,70,unknown,I have trouble with these.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,71,unknown,Um... Um... Um...
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,can you think of any good ones from other people who you're talking to um do you feel like there's one specific area that you want to focus on or do you feel like you've mastered you know the calories and fat grams maybe you want to focus on other aspects of health so like sleeping uh drinking water anything like that stretching stretching um yeah that probably should do that um
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"Well, you know, I think given that the weather is going to be turning cold, I really, and I've had this goal before and I haven't really quite met it, I really need to get to the gym more because I'm not going to be able to continue exercising outside."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,Right.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"And maybe the first going, even breaking that kind of mind self-imposed,"
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"you know, mind thing that is preventing me from going in the morning, which is really the best time for me to go, even if it's just for 40 minutes or so."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"I really need to do that because I'm going to have difficulty continuing the exercise, especially if we have a bad winter, you know."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,So let's say that.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"If I could even get there one time before work one day, that would be awesome."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,Sounds good.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"And then for a call next week, next Wednesday is the 20th."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"And at our normal time, 9 a.m., is that okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,85,unknown,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"Uh, yeah, that should be fine."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"Then I will talk to you then, and have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,"Okay, thanks."
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,You too.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,All right.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,93,unknown,Okay.
Margaret/6048.F.w9.9.13.17.MD.MP3,94,unknown,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,0,advisor,So we are in week nine of the study.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, I did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,2,advisor,We'll be going over the regular agenda.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,3,advisor,So we'll be talking about that lesson that Shirlene asked you to read.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,4,advisor,We'll be going over your SMART goal and then all of your data.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,5,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,6,advisor,So let's see here.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,7,advisor,"Lesson nine, stress management."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,8,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,9,patient,I did.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,10,patient,I looked it over.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,11,patient,"I mean, I didn't pore over it, but I did look at it."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,12,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,13,patient,"You know, I think it was interesting because I had a friend ask me once, you know, like, she's like, you seem stressed out."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,14,patient,"And I said, well, I said, everything's going well, you know."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,15,patient,"And she's like, no, you can still be stressed out even if things are going well."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,16,patient,And I felt like that's what was going on this week.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,17,patient,"Right now I'm taking, I'm studying Thai massage right now."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,18,patient,And so this week in particular is an intensive week.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,19,patient,It's not just an extended weekend once a month.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,20,patient,This is like a full week this week.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,21,patient,"And it's been hard because, you know, it's every day."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,22,patient,And so I've had to reschedule a lot of things.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,23,patient,"The lunch hour, as you know, has not been consistent."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,24,patient,So it changes.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,25,patient,"Like, I can't necessarily lock in things for other people, you know, and..."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,26,patient,"And it's been making me tired, obviously, because it's belly massage."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,27,patient,"So, like, I feel all weird."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,28,patient,Extra weird.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,29,patient,But it makes me tired.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,30,patient,"And then, like, I haven't been able to get as much exercise, like, real exercise in."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,31,patient,"Like, the conscientious, like, treadmill exercise in."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,32,patient,"But at the same time, I haven't eaten much because, you know, when you're getting your tummy rubbed, you don't want to eat."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,33,patient,You just don't want to eat.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,34,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,35,patient,"Yeah, so it's been weird about stress."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,36,patient,"It's a different kind of stress, I guess that's the way I think about it."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,37,patient,"And I've been thinking, well, class will be over, and it'll just go back to my normal stress, but I think I'm more used to the normal stress than this."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,38,advisor,"Yeah, stress is definitely a big component in people's lives."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,39,advisor,I'm pretty sure every participant...
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,40,advisor,has mentioned that you know stress management is something that they really feel like they should work on you know not just because of the cues the eating cues that sometimes stress brings on but just you know overall general health so it's good you know to first identify that these are areas that you need to work on so it definitely sounds like you've done that and then just slowly maybe trying to find some strategies that you feel like will either you know help you maintain or deal with the stress or you know avoid those stressors things like that right right right like
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,41,patient,"You know, I haven't slipped out and said, well, I just need like an ice cream or carbs."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,42,patient,"I just, it's, which is a good thing."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,43,patient,"You know, I don't want to go on a bender."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,44,patient,"But, you know, it's, I'm learning to recognize actual stress and be like, okay, it's okay."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,45,patient,Just got to get through it.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,46,patient,"So, all good."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,47,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,48,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,49,advisor,"And then let's see, your previous SMART goal, so you had said you wanted to get on the treadmill every day."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,50,advisor,How did that go this past week?
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,51,patient,This week was hard because of the class.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,52,patient,"Like I said, I'd come home, I'd have to practice what I learned from class or do stuff, and I got a few in."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,53,patient,"I forced myself to get up pretty early yesterday and today to get the treadmill, go in in the morning, because I knew I'd be so tired at night."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,54,patient,"But then they had the opposite effect, so it's like I'm super tired even earlier because I got the treadmill in."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,55,patient,"But I'm hoping next week it'll be better because I won't have that kind of,"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,56,patient,I won't have class.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,57,patient,It'll be okay.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,58,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,59,advisor,"All right, then let's go ahead then and go over your data."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,60,advisor,So physical activity looked really great.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,61,advisor,"So across four days, you did a total of 477 minutes, so completely blowing past your 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,62,patient,I did?
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,63,patient,Really?
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,64,patient,"Yes, so really great job there."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,65,patient,I should pay more attention to that.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,66,patient,"You know, to be honest, unless I feel myself get on the treadmill for an hour a day,"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,67,patient,"you know, then, like, I don't count the little walking to the store, walking to the train kind of stuff, you know what I mean?"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,68,patient,"I really think about, have I been on the actual treadmill, so..."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,69,patient,"But, okay, if you say I've surpassed it, that's great."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,70,advisor,"Yeah, and then, let's see, looking at your diet component."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,71,advisor,"So this past week I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories five of those days."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,72,advisor,"Out of those five days, it looks like you met your calorie goal two of those days and your fat-gram goal one of those days."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,73,advisor,"So a little bit low in terms of where we'd like people to be, you know, in achieving those goals."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,74,advisor,But generally it looks like normally –
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,75,advisor,you do pretty well at meeting the goals.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,76,advisor,"Was there something different, you know, this past week in specific that, you know... Oh, you mean those two days that I was under?"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,77,patient,"Or... Well, no, because I always feel like I over... I eat too much, obviously."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,78,patient,Right.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,79,patient,"But there were two days in particular, I think yesterday and the day before, that I kept it low because we were doing intensive abdominal massage."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,80,patient,"Like, they weren't just rubbing the belly."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,81,patient,"They were, like, massaging organs."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,82,patient,and stuff and really following the digestive system so no one ate much.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,83,patient,And so you had to be prepared like the night before it and also obviously the day of.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,84,patient,So those are the only reasons why it was on the low side.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,85,patient,"But otherwise, I hate to say it, I'll probably go back up to the just over 1,500 mark, I think."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,86,patient,But I don't know.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,87,patient,"His week has been, it's almost like it's been a cleansing."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,88,patient,"So I don't feel as hungry as before, you know."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,89,patient,So it might help.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,90,advisor,"Looking at your data, it does generally look like you're maybe in like the 1600, 1700 range."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,91,patient,"Yeah, yeah."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,92,advisor,"You know, ideally we would like you to be at 1,500 or lower just because, you know, that's the range that would kind of incur the most weight loss."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,93,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,94,advisor,"So kind of thinking about that, do you maybe have any ideas in what might be helpful, you know, lowering that calorie consumption?"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,95,patient,"Well, because I had to have class every day here,"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,96,patient,"I had to prep my food because, you know, we don't want to go out and eat, and we don't want to eat too much because it's belly massage."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,97,patient,"So I'd actually like to take sort of the unintentional lessons I've learned this week for next week, like just have hard-boiled eggs ready to go."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,98,patient,"So if I'm hungry, I'll just snack on that."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,99,patient,We learned a few things about food combinations here.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,100,patient,"So I think maybe trying to not only just limit my caloric intake, but also think about how my caloric combinations are too, you know, so that things are a little bit more optimal."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,101,patient,"So I hope to do better next week for obvious reasons, because I won't have class, but also just from what I learned this week, you know."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,102,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,103,advisor,"And then let's see, most recent weight I see is 189."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,104,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,105,patient,"Yeah, 189.2 from this morning."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,106,patient,I had it down to 188.8 yesterday.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,107,patient,"But I think I'm still lower than last week, though."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,108,advisor,You actually checked in at 189 last week as well.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,109,patient,"Oh, on Wednesday?"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,110,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,111,advisor,"But, you know, a one-week maintain isn't, you know, too much of a big deal."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,112,advisor,"You've been losing weight, you know, since you started the study."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,113,advisor,"Probably just do, like I said, to those that you only met the goals two of the days."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,114,advisor,"So, of course, you know, the more days that you meet that calorie goal, we'll probably see that weight come off faster."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,115,patient,a one-week maintenance period isn't really... Right.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,116,patient,"Oh, I know what it is, too."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,117,patient,I think it's because I was eating dinner on the later side because I couldn't eat during the day.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,118,patient,"And then, of course, if I don't get the exercise in, it's not balancing out."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,119,patient,"So, yeah, there you go."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,120,patient,Lesson for next week.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,121,patient,Eat earlier and less.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,123,advisor,"Really at this point now, it's just kind of putting that into action, which is usually like the hardest part of it."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,124,patient,"Right, right, right."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,125,advisor,"So thinking about, you know, general overall goals you have for, you know, your performance this upcoming week, you know, kind of what are you thinking?"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,126,patient,"I hate to say it, but I'm going to do the same thing again, try treadmill every single day."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,127,patient,"I have a gig, an opera gig next week, so I know my time will be a little bit weird, but I won't be as stressed out trying to learn new stuff like I have been this week."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,128,patient,"I'm a musician, so all of it mostly is really just showing up and doing the job."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,129,patient,So that's a lot different than actually being kind of present in class.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,130,patient,Right.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,131,patient,"I'm hoping that makes a ginormous difference, actually."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,132,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,133,advisor,"Yeah, did you want to set that as your SMART goal, just making sure to get on the treadmill?"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,134,patient,"Yeah, the treadmill, yeah, yeah, the treadmill still, and really try and keep it under the 1,500 mark."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,135,patient,I would like to do that.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,136,patient,"Because I know now it's only three more weeks, and I think my goal, to reach my goal at the end of the program was to lose another four pounds, I think, and"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,137,patient,"If I can't lose four pounds in three weeks, that's kind of bad."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,138,advisor,"Well, you know, everyone loses weight at a different pace."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,139,advisor,The only thing you can do is just do your best.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,140,advisor,"And like I said, it does sound like you definitely know what you need to do."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,141,advisor,"It's just making sure you hold on to that motivation and, you know, your willpower and really putting that into action."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,142,patient,"Yeah, it's the willpower."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,143,patient,"Yeah, totally."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,144,advisor,"Okay, and then for that next call as well, please go ahead and read lesson 10."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,145,advisor,That one is called mindfulness.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,146,advisor,"So this one is talking about mindful eating, which is really just being, you know, paying attention to the foods that you're putting into your body, slowing down, things like that."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,147,advisor,"And then for your and Shirlene's call next week, do you usually have a set day and time that you talk or do you need to do a different day?"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,148,patient,I'm going to schedule my different kids.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,149,patient,"I guess I've got a gig next week, so that does mess my schedule up a lot."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,150,patient,"But I'm going to say that any time on Thursday works for me, and it doesn't matter when."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,151,patient,Let me look at her schedule.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,152,patient,"Yeah, because that one I'm not going to change."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,153,patient,I don't have to.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,154,patient,There's no class.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,155,patient,There's no rehearsals that day.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,156,patient,"There's just me at the office, so Thursday should be absolutely fine."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,157,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,158,advisor,"Then let's go ahead and say next Thursday, the 31st, at 11."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,159,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,160,advisor,"And then, of course, if you need to change that, then just go ahead, send her an email, or give her a call, okay?"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,161,patient,"I will, okay."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,162,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,163,advisor,"Well, thank you so much for talking to me today."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,164,advisor,"I wish you all the best of luck in the study, okay?"
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,165,patient,"Oh, thank you, Myra."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,166,patient,I really appreciate you guys accommodating my weird schedule today.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,167,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,168,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,169,advisor,Have a great weekend.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,170,patient,"Okay, you too."
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,171,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,172,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6050.F.w9.8.25.17.MDforSW.MP3,173,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,So we are in week 10.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to find out, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Lesson 10 was called Mindfulness.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Okay, and what did you think of that one?"
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"I think this one really subconsciously applied to me because I don't, you know, I mean, like the whole thing is about eating consciously and mindfully, and I think I do a lot of my eating consciously."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,the bulk of my calorie intake is when I'm not really thinking about it.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,So this is something that I think I should pay attention to.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Like, I've reduced a lot of the snacks that I used to eat, you know, chips and dip and stuff like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"So I've made healthier choices, but I'm still eating too much of the foods, you know, that I've substituted, like hummus and stuff like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"So, yeah, it's just a matter of..."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"You know, like throughout the day when I'm at work and when I'm, you know, for breakfast and stuff like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"And even when I'm on my way to class, I'm really careful about what I eat and I'm really conscious about it."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"But when I get home, that's when it's like, well, you know, everything kind of goes out the window and my fat grams go up and everything else."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"Yeah, so I do know that that is something that you brought up before."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"And definitely not the easiest thing to kind of change, especially this is a habit that you've built up for a long time."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"So of course, it might take a little bit longer to change that habit."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,But I'm glad to hear that at least with the classroom situation that's changed.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,I know that was a concern of yours a few calls back.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,So good to hear that that is being worked on a little bit.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"Yes, and so your SMART goal was related to that as well."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"You talked about wanting to switch up from having the mochas before class, trying to have coffee or water instead, not eating a full dinner, things like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,So how has that been going?
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,It went well.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"Yesterday I had a skim latte, but I left out the syrup, so it was just skim milk and coffee because I was really dragging."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,Otherwise I would have skipped it.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Um, yeah, so that's been pretty good."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"I, uh, the, like really, I've, I got into the habit of going to Starbucks and getting a mocha cause I like them."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"They're tasty, but, um, kind of, I really have been questioning, do I really want one?"
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"Um, you know, is it, is it really necessary?"
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Cause I make pretty good coffee at home.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"Um, maybe I could save some money and not go there."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"Um, and also like when my husband and I are wandering around and we'll,"
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"talk about, you know, let's go for a pint or let's go for some ice cream, and I'll say no, and he's like, oh, I guess I won't either, you know."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"So we've been kind of feeding off each other that way, not, you know, he'll bring it up or I'll bring it up, and then we'll get there and we'll be like, yeah, I don't really want one."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,So he's not really thinking about it.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,Do I really want that or no?
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"And often it's just a habit and just because it's, you know, it's a treat rather than because we really want it."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"And then, let's see, your data this past few days."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"So we just talked on Friday, so only about five days have passed."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"Across these five days, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all five of those days."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,And then you met your calorie and fat gram goal two of those days.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"It looks like the holiday weekend, you went a little bit over your goal, nothing too outrageous, but your calories did get a little bit high."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,Do you feel like that was due to the holiday weekend?
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"No, actually, we didn't go anywhere."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,I went to see a new doctor.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,My doctor retired.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"No, not retired."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,He's gone into another practice.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,He's gone into...
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,so he's no longer my primary.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"So I had to go find a new one, and I actually went and got my flu shot and tetanus shot and got my blood levels done to kind of get a gauge as to, you know, maybe I thought that might be a good thing to kind of use as a baseline as well."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"So, yeah, the flu shot knocked me out."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"One of them, or both of them, knocked me out."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,I didn't really get out of bed much at all this weekend.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"And when I did get up,"
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,I'm trying to think of what I did.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,I think I just ate whatever we had around the house instead of cooking.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"I just kind of got up and, you know, we have kind of like these pre-prepared canned meals that we'll resort to and, you know, last choice."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"And that's what I was eating instead of, you know, eating healthy."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"Yeah, that was great."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"Pretty much I didn't get out walking as much as I wanted to, and I also didn't eat the way I was planning on it because I really felt miserable."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,It started Friday.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,I'm trying to think.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,I don't think.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,I think I did go out.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"I went out for dinner I think Saturday, and I ended up eating just half of my burger and half of my fries."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"So I was really careful at lunch, and then at dinner things fell apart there."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,It's kind of the same thing.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"Like, in the morning, I'm pretty good, and then in the evening, that's when I'm, you know, I'm not so good, and I don't, you know, I've got to figure out how to cut things down or be more conscious of it."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Yeah, I'm so sorry that happened."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,It's terrible.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"I've definitely had a shot where that's happened to me before, but I know it's weird."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"Oh, my God."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"Oh, yeah."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Yeah, as of, like, Saturday evening, I was feeling better, and by Sunday, I was almost 100% again."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"Yeah, I saw you even did some physical activity these past few days, so I hope you didn't try to overexert yourself or anything."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"No, no, no, just been getting out again."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,I love this weather.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,I can be out all day on this.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,Definitely.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,So I see 145 minutes across four days.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,So your physical activity goal for this week is 294 minutes.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,"It already looks like, you know, you've done some activities."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,That's good.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 189.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,A little bit of fluctuation over these past days.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,I saw you got as low as 187.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,So we're definitely seeing a downward trend and you are one pound down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,So everything is looking good there.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"You are, let's see, two pounds away from your goal."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,"And since we're only in week 10, I definitely think we have enough time to kind of hit that."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,So everything still looks good and it looks like you're on track for everything.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,Did you have any questions or did you want to bring up anything on this call?
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"No, no."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"All right, are you still receiving those text messages from us?"
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"All right, then our next lesson, let's see, is going to be number 11."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,I hadn't thought of that.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,Is there anything from the mindfulness lesson that maybe you wanted to put into practice this week?
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,"Yeah, I think that would be a good one."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,"I mean, that would be good for me to do that, kind of be more mindful in the evenings and, like, maybe just even track what I'm eating specifically in the evenings."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,"I was kind of flipping through the ideas, how hungry are you and how sated are you."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,I'm trying to think of what would actually resonate with me and that I think would work for me.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,I haven't really figured it out because I don't tend to shop off of my list.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,I do make a list.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,I don't shop off of it.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"When I do, it's usually something that's not unhealthy."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,It's probably more fruits and veggies than I normally would get.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,So that didn't quite resonate.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"But, like, maybe if I just kept a journal of what I'm eating in the evening."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,And then.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,"Oh, sorry."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,Go ahead.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,"No, I was going to say go from there."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,Maybe that'll trigger something.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,"And I think even though you are tracking all your foods, I think when people, like, write down separately what they're eating in the evenings, they really start to see this trend."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,"Like, they might have certain cravings during the evenings or certain cues set off, you know, certain patterns, things like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,So that will definitely be interesting.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,"Okay, for our call next week, what is a good time for you to talk?"
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,132,patient,Wednesday's a little screwy next week.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,Maybe Thursday?
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,134,advisor,"Sure, and then what time?"
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,"How about 11.30 or 12.30, either one?"
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,136,advisor,"Okay, 11.30 should be fine."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,I'm going to change it right now.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,So the 14th at 11.30.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,140,patient,Perfect.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,141,patient,Perfect.
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,142,advisor,"All right, then I will talk to you then, Jolene."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,"Thanks, you too."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6052.E.w10.9.6.17.MD.MP3,146,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week 11."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Lesson 11 was called Balance Your Thoughts.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,"Okay, and what did you think of that lesson?"
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I liked that one.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"I thought it was... I didn't see that I did... I had, like, the all or nothing attitude, but I definitely see where I could use some tweaking here and there."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"Yeah, and then..."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"Yeah, these last few lessons are a little more abstract."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,I feel like the beginning lessons are kind of just more like telling you what to do.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"And then these last ones are a little, require a little more thinking."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"So maybe just something that, you know, you think about for the next year or so."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Let's see, your previous SMART goal."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,So you had said you want to track what you're eating specifically in the evening.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,So how is that going to look?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,That went pretty well.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"And I kind of paid more attention, more close attention to it."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"And I realized that I really do, it really is a trend."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Like, during the day, especially at work, I'm totally fine."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"And then I get home and I'm like, it's not a free-for-all."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"I've gotten rid of a lot of, like, the crap food."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"But I do, like, it's not like a binge, but I eat more than, I'll eat past the time I'm hungry."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"It's usually pretty decent food, but if I do have a beer, then it's like game over."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,I'll end up eating more than I normally would have.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"Yeah, so now that you've kind of identified this pattern that occurs in the night, what are you kind of thinking about doing with that information?"
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Oh, I've already started."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"I have reduced, especially when..."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"When I have food around, I will not, I just won't drink at all."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"So I've had a couple of, like every other day, I'm trying to make it every other day where I just don't drink at all, and that's helped."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"I noticed that, especially like Friday and Saturday, I had a big get-together and then a girls' night, and those were like just wasted days."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,I see the calories were just through the roof.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"And it was like over a series of several hours, so it didn't feel like I was overindulging."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"But then when you actually look at the data, it's like, holy."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,Right.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"So, yeah, it was like, yeah, I definitely did take in more calories through alcohol than was –"
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"that I was expecting, and it was surprising."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Yeah, I did notice this past week there was some high days, definitely."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"So, let's see here."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"Over this past week, I saw you record at least 1,000 calories six of the days."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,It looks like you met your calorie goal and fat gram goal two of the days.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"So, generally, you're a little bit better about meeting the goals, so it definitely does seem like there were those days where you were indulging,"
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"And, you know, generally on the days that we're expecting on the weekends."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,So I see that.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"And then, let's see, physical activity, six days recorded."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"You only did 165 minutes, so not quite your 294-minute goal."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,So that seemed to drop off as well.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,Right.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"So this upcoming week, you know, kind of need to get back on track with things."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,So.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Oh, I think this week actually is going to be extremely easy because I'm going to be, I'm leaving for Iceland tomorrow."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,I'll be gone for a week.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Yeah, and I'll be outside hiking like every day."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,So I don't think this is going to be a bad week.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"And it's not, there's nothing there to snack on."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"It's not like a, there's nothing there that's, you know, like a delicacy that I have to watch out for, I don't think."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"So, and I've already planned on, and also food is super expensive."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,So I'm planning on
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"buying, you know, buying what I need and cooking at home where we rent a house."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,So I won't be eating out much at all.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,So I think this week is going to actually be pretty easy.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,Great.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"And then, let's see, most recent weight I see is 190."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,And then just want to check in with those text messages.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,Are you still receiving those?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"I don't think my SIP, I've got my SIP back on all the time."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,I don't think it's connecting at all.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,Do you think it's the battery or do you think it's something else?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"No, it seems to be working, but I don't think it's the app."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"Yeah, we have noticed some issues with the Android phone, so we're trying to kind of get that figured out."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"But, you know, it's always a process."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"Yeah, exactly."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"If you notice any big discrepancies in the physical activity, of course, go ahead and enter it manually just so you're credited for it."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"But otherwise, you know, don't worry."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"No, I've been actually entering."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,The only activity that is entered is manual.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,It doesn't seem to be picking it up.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"Yeah, I'll make a note of that."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,Thanks for letting me know.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Sure.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"Our next lesson is going to be number 12, weight loss plateau."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"Well, I definitely want to get back to my 300 minutes."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,300-minute physical activity goal?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"Yeah, yeah."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"Alright, and then just to let you know, our call next week will be our last one, so it will be a little bit longer than our regular calls because we just want to wrap up, talk about what you should be expecting after the three-month assessment, things like that, okay?"
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,103,unknown,Uh-huh.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,"Alright, and then next Thursday, that is going to be the 21st at 1130."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,"Actually, I'm going to be, I'll be out of the country."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,"Oh, right."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,So I was wondering if I could change it to Monday or Monday or Wednesday of the following week.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,Let's go ahead and do Wednesday.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,Do you have a preferred time?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"Like the morning or we have to account for the time difference, right?"
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,"Yeah, so I mean, I'm sorry, the following week."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,So Wednesday the...
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,Is it the 26th?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"Oh, so we actually cannot do that because you will have officially been done with the intervention."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,I could do the 25th.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,The 25th?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,How about the 24th?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,"Uh, the 24th is, uh, Sunday."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,"Uh, what is it?"
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,"Oh, the 25th is a Monday."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,"Yeah, that'll be fine."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,"And then, um, 11?"
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,"Uh, yeah, that's great."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,"All right, then I will talk to you then."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,"Have a good week, all right?"
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,You too.
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,136,advisor,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6052.E.w11.9.14.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,We are in week five of the study.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, okay?"
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,"So lesson five, that one was called Navigating Social Queues, Gatherings, and Holidays."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,What did you think of that lesson?
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"Well, I thought it was pretty straightforward and self-explanatory."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,I didn't have any questions about it.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,I would think if anybody is the...
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,culprit I guess would be me because I'm the one who's like oh let's let's snack I'd rather snack or I'd rather do this um my husband is an awesome um person to turn to in order to help motivate um and I can I've gotten pretty good at ignoring him so uh I should be taking more you know taking more directive he's very subtle I mean he's extremely supportive and uh
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,He's a fantastic example.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"He'll just go out and run and get up and go and do his thing, despite what I'm doing."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"I think the one thing that he engages in that I tend to do as well is when he goes for burritos, I'll get a burrito."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"Or if he gets ice cream, I'll get myself chips."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,But it's really not him pushing me at all.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,It's my own lack of willpower.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,isn't uncommon so it's glad that you've identified that at least and you know kind of where to work on let's see your SMART goal so you had talked about kind of getting on and off at different train lines so you would have to walk more how did that
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,It was good.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,I actually got out walking at lunch as well.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"So I did not only the train lines, but there was one day it was raining, so I did take my regular route, but at lunchtime it wasn't, so I did go out and walk."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Looking at your data, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days this past week."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"It looks like you hit the 1,500-calorie goal two of those days and then the 42-fat-gram goal not quite."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,So let's talk a little bit about last week.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,Did anything in particular go on or kind of how was it trying to meet the goals?
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"I'm trying to think of what, I don't think there's anything specific."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"I actually, I think I just ate more food before."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,This is not really stupid.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"But, like, I'd eat healthier for the most part."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"I didn't have any fried foods, which is one of my bains."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,I didn't have any chips.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,But I would get healthy foods when I'd kind of binge on them.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Like, I don't know if it's that I didn't feel as full."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,Or there was a couple of days where I had two or more glasses of wine.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"And in this lesson here, it does mention that that will really mess with you."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"Like, it will..."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,And I know this.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,It's good to see it in writing.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"Like, if you have wine, it will lower your willpower and make you feel hungrier."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,So I definitely thought that was the case.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"So if I had leftovers, I'd, like, portioned out my food I was thoughtful about, portion control, and then I would have a glass of wine."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"I'd be like, you know what?"
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,And I'd go off and eat whatever was left.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,So...
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"Yeah, I cut down on the cheese."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"I cut down on fried food, but I definitely ate more food overall."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"Yeah, so it sounds like this is kind of something that has come up the past few weeks."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"Good to hear you know, again, recognizing that there are areas that you need to improve on is definitely helpful."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"And also, like you said, cutting back on certain foods is helpful as well."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,do you feel like maybe there are any other changes that you could make to kind of help you stick closer to the calorie goal?
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"Or do you feel like there's anything that maybe you've identified now that you hadn't known before that, you know, causes you to kind of go over your goals or anything like that?"
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,I don't think there's anything that I really didn't know before.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,I think it's just I'm becoming more conscious of it.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,We order out quite a bit.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"And I've been good about ordering the healthier choices, like the tandoori chicken with no skin, for example."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,But then I'll eat the whole thing.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,So what I should really be doing is just cooking at home and portioning it out at home rather than ordering out and trusting myself not to eat at all.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"As I have been, I've been good about weeding out most of the foods that I found kind of tripped me up at the beginning, like, you know, the full fat foods, the chips and the cottage cheese with 4% milk and stuff."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"So I've been good about weeding that out, but now I have to really focus on cooking and weeding out the takeout."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"So, yeah, again, a lot of insight there."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,Let's kind of see how it goes this week.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"Putting that into practice, that's always the hardest part."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Is there anything coming up this week, you know, any, like, social engagements, anything like that that might cause any problems?"
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"Well, I'm having a brunch on Saturday, but seeing as I'm setting the menu, it won't be a problem."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,I think holidays don't tend to be much of a problem for me because I like to be super active in the kitchen and hosting.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"So I'm actually eating less at holidays than I am the rest of the year, if that makes any sense."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"So I'm actually running around and cooking and shopping, and I get a lot of activity in and out."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"I tend to just kind of sample here and there, but I don't actually eat a full meal."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"I'll just taste things, make sure they're good, and then it's the leftovers after the holiday that will trip me up."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,So I guess that kind of comes into play with this weekend if I'm hosting a brunch to make sure that I don't have too many leftovers because I will snack on them.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,And then?
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,let's see physical activity this past week um so i'm looking out for physical activity i'm looking at from the 24th to the 30th uh looks like um you recorded six days of physical activity you did a total of 280 minutes so super super close to that 300 just a little bit shy um and then your goal for this week um is still 300 minutes so um how are you feeling about that physical
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Good.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,I was actually tripped up this week.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"I had a, I don't know if it was a stomach bug or a touch of food poisoning."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,So that kind of laid me up Saturday and Sunday.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"But otherwise, I would have made it and I feel comfortable with it."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 192.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,So that is a pound down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,So still losing weight.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,Still on track.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,So doing very well overall.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"Just like you had said, maybe pay more attention to some food choices here and there, but overall not too bad."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,"Okay, let's see."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,Are you still receiving the text messages from us?
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,I don't think I'm getting text messages.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,I'm getting your notifications.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,"We call them text messages, but they're not really in-app notifications."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"For our next call, if you could go ahead and read the next lesson, so Lesson 6."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,"This one is just checking in on your motivation since, you know, you are basically at the halfway point."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,"Oh, man."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,"I think I'd like to go back to the – if I could do two of them, I'd like to kind of circle back to the alcohol and the gym."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,So maybe cut out alcohol three nights and limit myself to two glasses any other night and then go to the gym at least twice.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,So I'll say twice.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"All right, and then for our call next week, so that is going to be the 9th at 1230."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,Is that okay?
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"I'm going to be in a meeting most of the day that day, but I am free."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,Let me just really quickly open my calendar.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,"I'm working from home, I believe."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,"Next Friday, the 11th."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,And I'm also free at about any time between 11 and 2 on the 10th.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,"Ah, okay."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,"Fridays are always a little bit iffy, like I had said before."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,"You know, we miss that call, then we miss a week."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,It gets complicated.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,I could also do 2.30 on the 9th.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,Sorry.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,132,patient,Any time between 11 and 2.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,135,advisor,Can we do 1 o'clock on the 10th?
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,That would be great.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,137,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,138,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,140,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,141,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,142,patient,You too.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,144,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6052.E.w5.8.2.17.MD.MP3,145,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"We are in week six, so we are now officially halfway done with the initial part of the study."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"So just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"We'll be going over our regular agenda, so we'll start off with that lesson six, ways to stay motivated."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I was.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Unfortunately, I don't have it with me."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"I'm at work, and I kind of need a refresher."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"At this point, we just want to check in with how people are feeling about the study."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"We know that a one-year research study is a really long commitment, and we are asking you to do a lot of different things."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"So just at this point, how are you feeling about your motivation?"
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,I actually think it's good.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"And I think that the fact that it is a year long is an excellent idea, because it's going to take that long to implement changes"
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"Bit by bit, you know, I've had some terrible habits that I've had for years."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,Right.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"So I think it's a, I'm actually glad that it's a year."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"And I feel that if it's a much longer period of time, like, you know, six months, a year, whatever, that I'll be more likely to stick with it and actually develop habits that will stick."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"Now that you've had some time, you know, dealing with the goals, is there something that you kind of really want to focus on, you know, for this last initial part, or maybe, you know, something that you had in mind that you feel like you could improve on, anything like that?"
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"Well, I definitely think the grams would be the worst, the best thing to focus on."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Like, definitely too much of my intake."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"All right, then let's see."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"With your SMART goal, so you had wanted to repeat the one about the alcohol, so you were cutting that out three nights."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,You had also mentioned you wanted to go to the gym twice.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,So how did that go last week?
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"It went well, yeah, especially the gym part."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Once I got there, I pretty much didn't want to leave."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,That's great.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"So it's been eight days since we last talked, so I'm looking at data from last Wednesday, August 2nd, until yesterday, August 9th."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Let's see, I saw you recorded at least 1,000 calories all eight days."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,Looks like you met your calorie goal four of those days and your fat gram goal one of those.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,I would echo your thoughts.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Fat grams, definitely something that we need to look into."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"I know earlier on in the study you had mentioned that, you know, you had thrown out a lot of those, you know, higher-fat foods, trying to make those substitutions."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,But kind of where do you feel like you stand right now?
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Why do you think that's still, you know, challenging for you?"
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,I think it's the fullness.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,I don't feel full.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"Without, yeah."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"More the, not like ice cream and candies and things like that, but like the, I just love, I really crave not only salty fats like chips and things like that, which I've cut down pretty well, but meats and even things like avocados."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"Like I can eat, I can eat a full avocado without blinking."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"And if I don't include it, I actually feel hungry."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"And that's something I'm trying to, you know, just, like, deal with."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,You know what I mean?
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"Like, every once in a while I will feel hungry, and that's okay."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"You know, with any diet change, a little bit of hunger is normal as long as you're not starving or, you know, feeling faint, anything like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,That is when it gets dangerous.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"But, yeah, just please be aware, you know, there is going to be a little bit of hunger no matter what."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,And I'm looking through your food data right now.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"So I do see, yeah, a lot of avocado."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,And I do see salmon and tuna.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"So those, yeah, are definitely going to be higher fat foods."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,They're not...
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"You know, people differentiate between, like, bad fats and good fats."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"You know, they're not considered bad fats, but you're, again, I think I said this before, your body's going to store it the same way."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"So, you know, with that, generally, you know, with the meat, we tell people, you know, try finding meats that are leaner, like chicken, things like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"And then also, you know, just upping the intake of vegetables always helps, fruits and veggies, since those are healthier for you."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"And maybe, you know, adding a little bit of carbs if you feel like you need that so, you know,"
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"however you want brown rice, whatever your carb of choice is."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"Generally, it looks like you're around mid to upper 50s, so it's not too bad by any means."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Good.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Physical activity, really great."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"Six days recorded, 315 minutes, so you did meet your goal."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 190.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"Yeah, so that's actually two pounds down from the last time we checked in, so really great job there."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Obviously, this is still working, so definitely doing great things."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,How are you feeling about your weight loss progress so far?
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,Good.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"Like, it's definitely not huge, but it's steady, which makes me happy, yeah."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Wow.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"Okay, so like I said, everything is looking pretty good."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,How is this upcoming week looking?
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,"Any big barriers you feel like you're going to face, anything like that?"
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"Not at all, actually."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,Monday is the only day that I would be kind of scrambling.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,The rest of the week is pretty open.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"Okay, awesome."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,"All right, then I just want to check in."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,"Have you still been receiving those text messages, the in-app notifications?"
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"All right, then for our next lesson, if you could just go ahead and read Lesson 7, that would be great."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"I think I just want to stick with, I guess, continue sticking with and observing the same things I have been with the grams and the gym."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,Maybe up the gym to three.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"And then for our call next week, is it okay if we talk at our Wednesday time, 1230, or do you need a different time?"
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,"Oh, Wednesday at 1230 is great."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,"So that's going to be next Wednesday, the 16th at 1230."
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,Great.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,Thank you so much.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6052.E.w6.8.10.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so let's see."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,Here we are in week seven.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Let's see, lesson seven, were you able to get to that one?"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Yes, and I got through lesson six as well."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"Okay, awesome."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,So anything major that you liked in either of those two lessons or anything that you felt was relatable?
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"I thought lesson six was really great, I thought."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"just the motivation, staying motivated."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Um, and the guidelines, like the, not only putting the chart up on the fridge, that sort of thing, physical activity, that's one that I think I'm going to add."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"Um, I've got the weight loss in the app and that shows the graph, but the physical activity is something that I'm really slacking on."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"So, um, I'd like to see, you know, like kind of like see a little bit of progress every week in that."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"And the, um,"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"The vision, what is, I can't remember the name, Jay Kmesic, the intrinsic exerciser, you know, kind of not comparing yourself to other people and doing, you know, envisioning yourself as an exerciser at your own level and watching yourself in comparison only to yourself as you develop."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,I thought that was really helpful.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"Okay, and then your previous SMART goal, so..."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"You said, you know, making sure that you go to the gym at least three times a week in order to help stay with the goals, things like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,So how did that go?
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,It didn't go super well.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"No, it didn't go very well."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,I think I got there once.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"And, again, I mentioned this last week."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"It's like when I get there, I'm fine."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,It's just getting there.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"And I've added on a class, though, this week."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,I'm taking Italian.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Oh, wow."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"At first I thought that was going to be even more of a hindrance to working out, but I think it's actually helpful because I find when I do come home, I tend not to leave again."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"So here I'll be, you know, I'll be out working and then I have to go to class."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"So I'll actually, and I find that I'm actually not, I'm not tired at the end of the day."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"Yesterday I was tired, but it was mostly because I had to walk"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"uh, four miles to work because my train was stopped."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Um, but I did, I did, but it was okay because I, you know, I got off at Belmont and there was a mob of people and I was like, I'm not waiting."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,So I just walked to work.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"And even though I walked to work and I worked all day and then I went to class, I still, um, you know, I wasn't dead at the end of the day and I was still enthusiastic in class."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,And it just kind of proved to me that I have
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"Nothing to worry about as far as, you know, I'm not going to be tired if I work out."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,One of the other hindrances to working out this week was committees.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,I had two of them in.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,And then I was added.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,I had one added onto my schedule that was not anticipated.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,So I was in meetings all day Monday.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"And I found myself being, you know, kind of not depressed but bummed, you know."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"I had these plans and I was supposed to be working from home this week and I ended up going to work and so it's like when it came to the slippage,"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"This week's reading, that was absolutely me this week."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Yeah, so it sounds like you faced a lot of different barriers this past week."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"A lot going on, but definitely good, you know, you found a way to kind of help push you to go to the gym, you know, especially like you said."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"You won't be going home, so maybe that'll help you kind of just go straight to the gym."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,that's not the easiest thing.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Um, sounds like though, you know, you're really trying your best."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,So that is definitely important.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Um, let's see, looking at your data from this past week."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"So let's see, I saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories, five days of the week."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"Uh, and then it looks like you met your calorie goal."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,Two of those days didn't quite hit your fat gram goal.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"Any of the days, um, there were particularly two days last week that were quite high."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,So
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"What was going on last week, if you want to talk about it a little bit?"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Sure.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,I think that was committee-related.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"I found myself snacking, and then I'd get home and I'd eat more."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,I was starving.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"I'm kind of on my feet for, maybe not on my feet the whole time, but I'm working 10-hour days, and I'm on my feet a lot of it, and running around."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"At lunch, I was pretty good, but in the afternoon, they delivered the cookies, and I didn't"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,I did not stay away from those.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,And I'm trying to think.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"There was another day, too, where something else happened."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"I think, oh, cake."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"Yeah, it was my friend's birthday, and I actually picked up a cake for her."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,So it was my own fault.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,I went and got her a cake from Magnolia and I'll be eating a larger piece than I should have.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"That was, yeah."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,I definitely had not a good week.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"which is, you know, understandable, but kind of thinking back on, um, all the choices you made, if that's going to happen again in the future, what are some things that you think you can do differently?"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"Um, well, one of them is, uh, bring snacks."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"I think with, um, with the afternoon, I, you know, yes, I am hungry in the afternoon."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,They bring the cookies and it's like not that big and I feel satisfied after I eat it.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"But if I had something else like hummus and, uh, celery, I'd be much happier."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"Um,"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,with the whole outcome because I love hummus and celery.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,It's just as tasty to me personally as cookies.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"But since I don't have it and all that I'm offered is cookies, that's what I'm going to eat."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,So I'll have to make an effort to bring my own snacks.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"And I actually have a meeting coming up this week, so I'll make that a goal for this week is to bring my own snacks to my meeting."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,So I won't snack on the cookies.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,"It's my birthday today, so I have to make sure to not –"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,overindulge i already have i had a stuffed donut for breakfast so i have to make sure not to let make that my you know meal plan for the day and um yeah eat healthy yes i did see that it was your birthday so happy birthday thank you so yes i'm sure there's probably gonna be a lot of you know celebrating tonight and probably over the weekend as well but um you know
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"with these kinds of things, we usually say, of course, you should enjoy yourself, but just remembering, you know, the next day, trying to get back on track, not going too overboard, but of course, you know, take this time to kind of, like I said, enjoy yourself, have that cake, okay?"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Physical activity.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,So last week your goal was 300 minutes.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,I saw four days recorded.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,You did 120.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,So I definitely think focusing on going to the gym this week will definitely help push you towards your goal.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"Also, though, probably because of the walking yesterday, it looks like you're well on your way towards meeting that physical activity goal."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"Yeah, that felt good, I got to say."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"And then most recent weight, I see 191."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,So a little bit up.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,One pound up from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"Definitely a lot of things to focus on this week, but it sounds like you have a good plan of action, so that is great."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,"Hopefully, you know, next time we check in, the weight will fall down."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"We'll kind of talk about that then, okay?"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,Have you still been receiving those in-app text messages?
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,"All right, then, for our next call, if you go ahead and read Lesson 8."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,"That one is called Food Cravings and Cues, so maybe this will kind of give you some ideas on how to deal with any cravings you might be facing, you know, some substitutions you can make, things like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,"And then, let's see, what would you like your SMART goals to be for the week?"
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,I'd like to do the two.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,One of them is to bring snacks to my meetings.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,Stay away from the cookies.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,"And the other will be to swim, make it more specific than going to the gym."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,I like to swim more.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,Once this week and wait-lift once this week.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,"For our call next week, so if this day and time still works, next Wednesday is the 23rd at 1230."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,Would that be okay?
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,My meeting will be over.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,Would 130 be okay?
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,"Yep, that's fine."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,Perfect.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,139,patient,"Yeah, 130 would be good because my meeting ends at 1230."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,140,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,141,patient,Or 12 o'clock.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,142,patient,This will make sure I'm out of that room.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,143,patient,That was a problem last week.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,144,patient,I was trying to get down in the elevator down to the ground floor where we've got a kind of quiet space.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,145,patient,And I ended up being out in the hallway and all my coworkers walking past while I was talking to you.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,146,patient,So I apologize for that.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,147,patient,I was maybe a little more vague than I intended to be.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,148,patient,"Oh, no, no."
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,149,patient,It's okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,150,advisor,We understand.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,151,advisor,It definitely happens.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,152,advisor,So I'll put you down next Wednesday at 1.30.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,153,advisor,I want to talk to you then.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,154,advisor,Have a great week.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,155,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,156,patient,You too.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,157,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,158,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6052.E.w7.8.16.17.MD.MP3,159,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"The last time we talked, I had asked you to read Lesson 8, Food Cravings and Cues."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Did you happen to remember that one by any chance?
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"Could you – yeah, I did read them, but could you refresh my memory?"
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,So this one was just talking about certain cues that might make you want to eat.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,"So it talked about, you know, like hunger, what you're thinking."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"What other people might say or do is some cues, you know, the sight and smell of food, things like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"And it also talked about cravings, so why you might have a craving."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"There are some, you know, physical factors related to that, other ways to, you know, manage those cravings."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"It was a pretty brief lesson, but basically what we're just trying to get at is trying to help you to identify any cues that might make you want to eat and really just kind of categorize them."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"So one thing that people usually talk about a lot is like when they're watching TV, you know, they always kind of want to have something like in their hand or in their lap, you know, just eating something kind of mindlessly."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,Do you feel like that applies to you at all or maybe in a different situation?
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"Yeah, I think that is definitely one where I'm sitting and not doing anything."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"Like, yeah, definitely like watching TV."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"I've gotten pretty, I'm trying to make myself more aware of it."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"So, you know, if I start snacking, then I'll, or if I go to the, you know, pantry or fridge for a snack, I'll try to, you know, catch myself and see if I'm really hungry."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"And I'm also, like, the other day, my husband went off for his ice cream."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"And, of course, asked me if I wanted anything."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"And I said, chips."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"And then I stopped him and I said, no, hummus."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,I'll take hummus.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"So, you know, I was able to catch myself there."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,And really what I wanted was the crunchy snack with the salt.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,I didn't really necessarily need chips.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"And then let's see, thinking about snacks."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"So the last time we had talked, we had set a SMART goal."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"So one of the barriers that you had talked about was always snacking at meetings or, you know, just snacking at meetings."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,So you had wanted to bring your own snack.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"And then you also had set another goal related to physical activity, so swimming at the gym and trying to weight lift."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,So how did those all go either last week or the week before that?
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"Well, I didn't get to the swimming part, but I did get to the weight lifting part."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"And I did a lot of, did a ton of walking."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,I forced myself to walk a lot more than I normally do.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,I would get off a stop earlier or later or walk a little bit further than I had to or go out for a walk at lunch.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"Yeah, I did that and I did do the, I brought my own stuff to meetings or I did grab a couple of, they have, sometimes they have like that for yogurt."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,So I grabbed a few of those and I had that instead of the cookie later on.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,I did notice
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Later on at home, though, for some reason, I haven't really figured out why, I just ate more."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"Like at night, I think I was just starving when I got home."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"And I don't know if it's because I ate less during the day than I normally did or if I was, you know, if I worked harder than I thought or if I was just being a, I don't know, some kind of a comfort thing."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,I'm not sure.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"Yeah, it might be worthwhile to kind of..."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,think about that a little bit more.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"So just, you know, when you do catch yourself the next time kind of eating a lot at nighttime, maybe just thinking about what you did during the day."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Or maybe if, like that lesson had talked about, maybe a certain cue had kind of set you off to, you know, go to the kitchen and grab a late night snack, something like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Like you said, it could just be, you know, maybe a one-off thing, but if it keeps continuing, you know, maybe paying a little bit of attention to that."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,So let's go ahead and go over your self-monitoring data.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,So I'm looking at for the nutrition portion one week.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"So last Friday, the 25th, until yesterday, the 31st."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"So out of this seven-day period, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Looks like you met your calorie and fat gram goal one of those days.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,So definitely.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Is this what you're talking about in terms of the eating at nighttime?
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,Do you think that kind of played into it?
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"Yeah, I've also been – there's something else that's kind of been going on."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"I've been taking this Italian class, and I have kind of anticipating, oh, my stomach's going to start growling, so I'll eat something light beforehand."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,I've also been stopping at Starbucks for mochas.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,So that's actually my SMART goal is to –
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"There was one day I was actually in line for a mocha, and this woman ahead of me opened up a packet of cookies."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"And she offered me one, and I declined, and I said, you know, I'm on a diet, essentially."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"And I ended up instead of getting my mocha, because I'd said that to her, I got myself an iced plain coffee instead."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"So that's my SMART goal, is to eliminate the mochas before class, and either bring water or..."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,a plain coffee and I'll yeah and again keeping an eye on when I do get home not eating because I don't get home until 8.30 and then I go to bed at 9.30 so I'm you know whatever I'm eating there is probably I don't know if it's if it really is a big problem to eat that late but maybe not eating as much like not eating a full dinner just having that's something to keep me kind of tied me over
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"Very good, smart goals."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"So yeah, always with a little bit of change in routine, it usually brings up some other problems, but good that we're kind of catching them right away."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"Let's see, looking at physical activity, so last week I saw four days recorded."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"You did 335 minutes, so you did hit your 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,How are you finding the physical activity goal to be now that you're kind of a little bit more busy?
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Well, yeah, it's much easier."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"Oh, really?"
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Yeah, it's very easy."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"I mean, especially with this, again, with the Italian class, like I'm walking down there, which takes about 20 minutes, and at lunch I'm trying to walk, so especially with the weather being as nice as it is, it's been really easy this week."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"Oh, that's great."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"I was expecting you to say that it's been more difficult, but great that it's been easier."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"And I actually, I did get to, I did walk to the gym."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"I didn't get to work out because I didn't have enough time, but I did force myself to at least walk there, go in, look around, and then come back home or come back to my office so that I'm kind of gauging how far it is and how I can do it."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"So I'm just kind of scoping that out, scouting it out."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,And then most recent weight I'm seeing is...
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,"Yeah, so that is a pound down from the last time we checked in."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,You are super close to your weight loss goal for the study.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,Three pounds away.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"So, you know, with about three or so more weeks left in the study, I definitely think that's manageable."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,Let's just try to make these last three weeks really count.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,"And I think, you know, with everything that you've set up so far, it shouldn't be too bad, okay?"
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,Then just wanted to check in.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,Have you still been receiving those in-app text messages from us?
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,"All right, then for our next lesson, if you could go ahead and take a look at lesson 10."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,That one is called Mindfulness.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"So this one is talking about mindful eating, you know, really paying attention to what you're putting into your body, kind of slowing down while eating, things like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,Right.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,And then we have your SMART goal down.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"So a few different things, you know, eliminating that mocha, just paying attention to what you're eating during dinner, things like that."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,Right.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"And then for our call next week, let's see."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,When is a good day and time to talk?
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,We could stick to our Wednesday time at 12.30 or we could move it around if you'd like.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,"Will we be able to move it up a little bit on Wednesday, maybe 11.30 or 12?"
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"Yeah, 11.30 would be fine."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,"Great, perfect."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,"Okay, then I'll check in with you then the 6th at 11.30."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,"Have a great weekend, okay?"
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,Thanks.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"Oh, I just wanted to give really quickly the app."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,Finding the food is really a pain.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,I don't know if they can...
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,And maybe you could kind of push it forward to IT.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,"If they could figure out how to just alphabetize things, it's just so chaotic in there."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,I end up just creating more custom foods that are probably in there.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,I just can't find them.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,"But that would be, I think, if I'm finding it frustrating, I'm sure that others probably are as well."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,That would just be my only feedback on that.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,"Yeah, I will definitely go ahead and pass the message along."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,Thanks for letting us know.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,128,patient,"Oh, sure."
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,I'll talk to you soon.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,Have a good weekend.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,Thanks.
Margaret/6052.E.w9.9.1.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are officially in week one of the study."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, okay?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,on that tech call this call will be a bit shorter and a little bit different just because we don't have a full week's worth of data to look at just yet but otherwise we'll be going over that lesson that i asked you to read all the data that we can see so far so your calories fat grams and physical activity we'll set your first smart goal and then answer any questions or problem solve any issues you're
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"All right, so first off, how is the scale going?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,I know that you were having a lot of issues with it.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Did those get resolved?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"My husband does a tech, and he was able to figure it out."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,So it did work out.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,It seems to be sinking.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Okay, wonderful."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,I'm so sorry about that.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"Oh, no, that's okay."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"I mean, I felt bad."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"I figured if I was having trouble, and I feel I'm fairly tech-savvy, and my husband's a tech, I was like, oh, my God, I can't imagine what other people might be experiencing."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"So it could have just been our network, too."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,So hopefully they're not having any issues.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"Yeah, so far, you know, we have encountered some issues, but I'm just glad, you know, for your participation that it's going okay."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"And I do see that weight sinking over, so that's great."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,I did have a question about that.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,The...
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"The scale, I did notice in the packet it says that I can only use it on my home network."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,What if I'm traveling?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,Should I just do it manually?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Yes, that would probably be best."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"So to go over that lesson, were you able to get to Lesson 1?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Did you take anything away from that lesson or read something that you liked in particular?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Could you remind me which lesson that was?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,I read two of them accidentally.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"One of them was the first lesson, and then I read the one on portions."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Oh, no problem."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,So it was getting started with activity and healthy eating.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,It's basically like an intro.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"So did you learn anything new, anything like that?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,I don't think I learned anything new.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,It seemed...
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,It seemed pretty straightforward.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,I think it was the second lesson that really hit home with the portions.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Yeah, the first lesson, you know, is just kind of a reiteration of things that we said during the randomization session, things like that."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"So it's not, you know, most people just find it to be a good reminder."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,And then we'll go over that lesson two on our next call.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"If you want to, you know, just go over that before we talk next time, then that's fine."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"And I did, I've got the first lesson pulled up, so I'm just kind of scrolling through real fast."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"Oh, no problem."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"Like I said, we know that there are activities at the end, but we never really, you know, it's not like homework or anything, more like reflection."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Okay, so..."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"Make sure to follow the study and attend all the calls and reschedule if I have to, that sort of thing."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Yes, exactly."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"Okay, so let me go ahead and go over the data that I see on my side."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"So since your intervention just started on Monday, I'm only looking at Monday the 3rd in Utah."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"yesterday the 4th, okay?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"Alright, so out of these two days, it does look like you recorded at least 1,000 calories, which is great."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"If you remember during that session, we had said we want everyone to eat at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,We know it's just a good number for your body.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"to stay consistent for your metabolism, things like that."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"And then it looks like you met your calorie goal one of those days, and your fat-gram goal didn't quite meet that any of those days."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"So I know you're just starting on the study, and unfortunately, we just had a holiday."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"But in general, how are things going for you?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"Like I mentioned, it was kind of startling."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"I think I'm fairly intelligent, but the whole portion control,"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"The sizes of portions really is an eye-opener for me, and also the fat gram."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"I was shocked to see, not just as I started weighing myself and telling my calories and things last week, just how much, how far I was going over 2, 3, 4, 500 calories without even thinking, thinking that I was eating fairly well."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,fat grams definitely tend to be shocking for a lot of people i think just because in general nobody really keeps track of that um so we do know that it does take a lot of practice to kind of get those under control but using you know the portion size guide um keeping in mind you know um things like that also keeping up with your tracking should definitely help um so it definitely looks like um
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"You know, well, first, okay, if looking at the calories in the fat gram budget, which do you feel like is kind of harder for you at this point?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,The calories of the fat gram?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,Right.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"I think, boy, I guess it's the overall calories."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"In the fat grams, I'm going to, I think that will be a close second."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"I mean, they're almost the same."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Right.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"They're both really, it was really surprising to me."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,I've done weight tracking before.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,I think I tried something called Lose It.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,Or Noom Coach or one of those.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"And it seemed, I don't know, maybe there was a disreferencing in their data."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,I thought I was doing pretty well.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,And that was a couple of years ago.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"But yeah, this was a major eye-opener for me, the calories, I would say."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"So, again, I know it's only been two days, but just looking at your data so far and kind of thinking about areas that you want to improve, have you kind of already started to think of ways that you can kind of make changes in your diet?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"Going along with the fat gram, for example, I love cottage cheese with spinach, which I had today for breakfast."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"and I always get the 4% because I think, you know, I would think that it didn't really matter."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,It didn't make that much of a difference.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,The calories are almost the same.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"So if you look at the 2%, for example, or the skim cottage cheese, the calories are not, it's pretty nominal, you know, for a portion size."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"But then when you look at the fat grams,"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,Like that's really going to add up fast because we don't get that many of them.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"So that's one definite immediate change is going from the 4% cottage cheese, even though it's creamier and tastier, to something more low-fat and just adding some spices to it."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,Wonderful.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,"Yeah, so it already sounds like, you know, you're making some changes here and there, which are great."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,We know that it's kind of a long process.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,"You know, you didn't build up these habits in one day, so they're not, you know, going to change in one day, but already recognizing –"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"Um, areas where you need to improve is great."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,"Um, let's see then."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"Looking at physical activity, I don't quite see anything recorded just yet."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,"Just to remind you, your goal this week is 60 minutes."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"Um, do you kind of have a plan for how you're going to fit that into your week?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,"Oh, I actually, um, I added something yesterday."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,"Um, I did some moderate weight work."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,I was working in the basement and moving boxes for about an hour and a half yesterday.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,So I marked that in there as moderate weight training or moderate weight lifting.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"Um,"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,But that didn't come through?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,No.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,What did you set the RP as?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"Oh, the RP?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,121,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,"If you remember, you have to change the rating of perceived exertion whenever you manually enter physical activity."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,Do you happen to remember what you set it as?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,"Oh, yeah."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,Let me get that form.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,I think I put it at about 13 or 14.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,That's strange.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,I will make a note of that then and check to see if that came through.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,You said you edited it yesterday the 4th.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,And then you said about an hour and a half?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,135,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,136,advisor,Alright.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,137,advisor,Then I will check in on that.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,138,advisor,I'm not sure why that isn't syncing over.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,It might just have to be or it might just be related to like Wi-Fi issues or
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,140,advisor,Just to make sure that I actually saw this morning that the Fitbit app needed an update so maybe that
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,141,advisor,That actually you entered in me.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,142,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,"Anyway, I will check in on that and see what's going on there."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,But I'll just make a note that you did meet that goal.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,146,advisor,"So, so far everything is looking pretty good."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,147,advisor,"Sounds like, you know, definitely areas for improvement, but also already getting some goals met, which is great."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,148,advisor,Did you have anything that you wanted to talk about on this call?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,149,patient,"No, I think that's it."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,150,patient,"I did forget to put on my Fitbit yesterday morning, which is why I entered it manually."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,151,patient,"But, yeah, I just kind of went downstairs and decided I was going to start organizing things."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,152,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,153,patient,So that might not have – and that's why I had to do that.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,154,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,155,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,156,advisor,"Yeah, so like I said, not much to comment on since I don't have a full list of data to look at yet."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,157,advisor,"But like I said, so far."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,158,advisor,"that next call, if you could go ahead and read, or again, just remind yourself if you want to on that second lesson, healthy eating, we'll be talking about that one on that call."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,159,advisor,And then we can go ahead and set your first SMART goal.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,160,advisor,So have you heard of SMART goal setting before?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,161,advisor,Or have you ever set your SMART goal?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,162,patient,"I have for work, but not for a personal change."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,163,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,164,advisor,"So basically, you know, we're going to be setting these goals."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,165,advisor,"Once a week, every time we talk, they're just supposed to be kind of an area where you feel like you could improve to kind of achieve your overall goal of, you know, behavior change, weight loss, things like that."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,166,advisor,So did you kind of have an idea in mind of what you would like your SMART goal to be?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,167,patient,I would like to get to the gym and just spend an hour there just getting reacquainted with it.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,168,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,169,advisor,"So sometime this week, go to the gym for one hour."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,170,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,171,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,172,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,173,advisor,"All right, and then for our call next week, we can go ahead and do the same day and time if you'd like, or we can change it."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,174,advisor,It's up to you.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,175,patient,"Well, I'm going to be in with a committee next Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,176,patient,"So I could make it either in the later afternoon, sometime any time after, probably any time after 1 on Friday, or I can make it any time on Monday."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,177,patient,That's perfect.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,178,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,179,advisor,Then I'll put you down for next Monday at 2.30.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,180,advisor,I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,181,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,182,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,183,patient,You too.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,184,patient,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,185,advisor,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6052.F.w1.7.5.17.MD.MP3,186,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,So we are officially in week two of the study.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"I asked you to read Lesson 2, Healthy Eating."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,That's the one that starts with my plate recommendations?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,OK.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,And what did you think of that one?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"Again, I found it really helpful."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,And very eye-opening as to portion size.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"I liked the ways to swap out low-fat foods for high-fat, or I'm sorry, the opposite, high-fat foods for low-fat foods."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"Yeah, it was really quite helpful."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"Yeah, okay, and then your previous, Marco, so you had said you wanted to go to the gym for one hour."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,Were you able to do that?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,I did get there for half an hour.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,And what was the barrier to completing that one full hour?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Procrastination, mostly."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Yeah, I didn't account."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,I basically just kept putting it off.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Oh, I've got all weekend."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"I've got all Sunday, and then I ended up going this morning."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,So I just kept putting it off.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,It's a matter of getting into a habit.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"So, you know, of course you're going to have to do physical activity again this week."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"So in order to kind of avoid the same thing happening, do you kind of have a plan in mind?"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,I haven't really figured it out yet.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,I've got a committee coming in this week.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"So that's always, for me, a barrier because I always feel – and maybe you can help me with this –"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"I feel like I should conserve my energy because if I don't, I'll end up tired during these meetings."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,I have to run them.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,They're about eight hours long.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"So whenever I start physical activity, I tend to be tired, of course, for the first week or so."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"So I'm trying to figure out how to best manage my time and when to best do these, you know, to be active in order to keep myself from being tired during these meetings."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,But I also know that if I do...
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Some work in the evenings, even if it's, you know, on the way home, before dinner, and then just go to bed earlier, that that would work for me."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Yeah, that sounds like a good plan as well."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"You know, just..."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,a few things maybe that might be helpful.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"You know, if you treat, you know, going to the gym like you would treat a meeting, so, you know, put it into your calendar, making a commitment to yourself, you're definitely less likely to avoid that."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"Also, you know, I know that some people find it helpful to bring their gym clothes with them either, you know, so they can go directly after work."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"That stops them from, you know, making that trip home."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Then, you know, you might think, oh, you're already home."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"You can just skip that day, things like that."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"But, yeah, I definitely understand, you know, feeling tired from an eight-hour meeting."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,I cannot even imagine what that's like.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"And, you know, you don't have to do, of course, the 60 minutes all in one go."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,You have seven days to complete that.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"So, you know, we say at least try to do 10 minutes every day."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,That's helpful as well.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,Right.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"That makes it actually, yeah, putting it in that perspective is extremely helpful."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"I keep thinking my mindset is if I just go once,"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,I'll be done.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,And that's not necessarily the case.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,It's not necessarily the healthiest thing to do.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"You know, if you do a little bit of exercise every day, that's probably more beneficial than just going once a week and sitting on my butt the rest of the week."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,To go over your data.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"So the first thing that I wanted to ask you about, I don't see any minutes recorded with the Fitbit, but it does sound like you did go to the gym once."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,have been syncing over?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,Are they showing in the app?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,I think so.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,They are showing in the app.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,I think they are.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,OK.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,OK.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"Then I don't see anything on my end, so I will just make a note of that."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,OK.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"If you could approximate, you said you got to the gym 30 minutes last week."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Last week I worked out for about an hour and 15.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"And then is your goal showing up in the app as well, your physical activity goal?"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,I think it is.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"I'm on the phone now, otherwise I'd be able to."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,Sorry.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"Okay, no."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"Actually, I can check that."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,Can you hold on one second?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,Of course.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,I can just ask.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,Let me just click around here.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,"Yeah, take your time."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"Yeah, yeah, it does look like it's showing up on my app."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"All right, then let's see."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"With your other data, so I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,It looks like you met your calorie goal two of those days and your fat didn't quite hit that background.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,Right.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"Now that you're in, you know, the study you've done for about a week, why don't we talk a little bit about what you're finding most challenging?"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,I think there's a couple of things.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,I'm still getting used to the whole fat gram thing.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,And I guess the third thing.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,"So the fat grams, the second thing would be the empty calories in liquor."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,Like I generally have like a glass or two of wine or beer like in the evening.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,And that is a lot of calories.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,"No fat, but it's a lot of calories."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,And the third thing is leftovers.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,So right now I feel I don't want to waste food and I've got tons of food in the fridge.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"So what I'm doing is I find I'm trying to reduce the portions, but I still have foods that aren't super great in the fridge."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,So I've got like leftover biryani and I've got full fat cottage cheese and things like that that I'm eating and I've
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"that really eats up that, no pun intended, the fat grams super fast."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,It's crazy.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"So, yeah, it's very eye-opening."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,"But once those are out of the fridge, I'll be replacing them with better foods."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,"Yeah, that's good to hear."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,For now...
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,"So with the leftovers, actually, I guess it really does depend on what the leftovers are themselves."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,"But actually, we would rather, you know, participants take leftovers than trying to force them to finish, you know, one meal."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,And then you enter that into the app and you find out you go way over your calories.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,"But with, you know, the other food, do you feel like, you know, maybe there's someone else that could maybe eat those for you so you don't feel the need to kind of, you know, eat all that?"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,"Of course, I understand, you know, no one wants to waste food, but..."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,We do kind of want to help you meet that 1500 calorie goal as well.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,"Or, you know, maybe portioning those out across the week so you don't have to limit yourself entirely, but just cutting down on the amount that you're consuming."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,"At this point in time, what do you feel like, so we can, you know, focus on one of those things since you're..."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,You mentioned three different things that you're struggling with.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,"So out of those three things, what is one of those that you feel like you could maybe tackle this week?"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,"This week, definitely the alcohol."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,Just seeing that calorie jump has been eye-opening.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,So I'd like to limit that to cut out at least two nights where I'm not having any at all.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,"And then of those nights that I am having it, limit myself to one glass."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,138,advisor,Sure.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,140,advisor,"Yeah, unfortunately, you know, with alcohol, there aren't really that many, you know, healthier options."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,141,advisor,"I mean, some healthier options do exist, but most of the time we just find out, like you said, those do kind of just end up being empty calories and aren't really conducive to meeting those goals."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,142,advisor,"So two nights with no alcohol and then one having alcohol limit to one glass, correct?"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,143,patient,Correct.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,"All right, and then most recent weight I see is 196."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,146,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,147,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,148,advisor,"So, yeah, it definitely sounds like, you know, you've thought a lot about your participation so far and that we have a good plan moving forward."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,149,advisor,"Just need to stick to that, and then we'll see where we land next week, okay?"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,150,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,151,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,152,patient,"And I'll take your advice also as to exercise and think more about, try to change my mindset from feeling like I have to get it all done at once to,"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,153,patient,kind of portioning it throughout the week.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,154,advisor,"Yes, awesome."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,155,advisor,"Okay, then for our call next week, if you could go ahead and read lesson three."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,156,advisor,So this one actually might be very helpful for you.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,157,advisor,It's called Adding Activity to Your Day.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,158,advisor,"So it's just tips on getting in that physical activity, things like that."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,159,advisor,"And then we have your smart goal down, two nights with no alcohol, and then when you are having alcohol, limit it to one glass."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,160,advisor,"And then for our call next week,"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,161,patient,Is there a day and time that you would like to talk?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,162,patient,"I'm going to be on vacation, but I will have my phone with me."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,163,patient,I'm thinking right now it looks like Wednesday will be good.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,164,patient,"Actually, any time out, Tuesday or Wednesday will be fine."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,165,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,166,patient,Are you going to be in the same time zone or are you in a different time zone?
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,167,patient,I'll be in Eastern time.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,168,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,169,patient,So I'll be just one hour ahead.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,170,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,171,advisor,"So if I say next Tuesday the 18th, 1030 my time, so that would be 1130 your time, is that okay?"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,172,patient,"Yeah, perfect."
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,173,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,174,patient,Then I will put you down for that date and time.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,175,patient,"Then I will check in with you then, okay?"
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,176,patient,Great.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,177,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,178,patient,Have a good week and enjoy your vacation.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,179,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,180,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,181,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6052.F.w2.7.10.17.MD.MP3,182,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,So we are in week three of the study.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"And for this call, I asked you to read lesson three, adding activity to your day."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I did.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"And unfortunately, I read it last week, and I'm trying to refresh my memory."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,There is one coming up also on portion size.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,Is that lesson four?
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Okay, okay."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"So adding activity, we did talk about this a little bit last week."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"I have been trying to attack it in smaller bits rather than try to do it all at once, and that's really been a good mindset change for me rather than feeling, you know, it's 8 o'clock and I haven't done anything yet."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,I'll just give up and I'll try again tomorrow.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"And then the next day, oh, it's 8 o'clock."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,I haven't done anything yet.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,I'll try again tomorrow.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"So I went kayaking this week, and I went swimming, and I did a short jog, and it felt pretty good."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"So, yeah, I know that you're away right now from kind of like your regular routine."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,Do you feel like you'll be able to kind of keep this up?
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Yeah, actually, I'm more active right now than I am at home."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,We're in a good hiking area.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"We're on a lake, so I've been swimming and kayaking and walking around everywhere."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,The problem is the food.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,We're surrounded by lobster and whoopie pies and delicious Maine food.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"So I'm not doing super well this week with the food, but I have been keeping my portion size down."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,And I also did the wine.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,I'm able to keep that.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,Down a little bit.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"So I'm not quite balancing it out because of the extra food I'm eating, but I was able to increase my activity and reduce my wine intake."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Great, yeah."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Good to hear about that, wine, so that does mean that you met your SMART goal."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"You know, generally alcohol is kind of just empty calories, so... Mm-hmm, yeah."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Let's see then, looking at your data, so remember we're always going to go over one week's"
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,past work one past week's worth of data so i'm looking at the 10th to the 16th um and this time period it looks like you recorded at least a thousand calories six days and then met your calorie goal three of those days and your fat gram goal one of those days uh physical activity three days you did a total of 208 minutes so not quite that 300 minute goal but very very close um
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,I actually had a question about the 300 minutes.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,It had been 60 minutes?
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,And that has been increased?
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,I apologize.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"No, no."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,You don't have to apologize.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"That also increases based on kind of how well you're doing at meeting that goal, so that's why I kind of shot up there."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"Yeah, I saw the increase in the time, and I thought I meant to ask you about it, and I will keep that for this next week, definitely."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"All right, and then most recent weight I see is 194."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Okay, so that's actually two pounds down from the last time that we talked."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,So really great progress that we're seeing already.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"I know that you had mentioned, you know, this past week has kind of been difficult with the food choices."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"Can you kind of tell me a little bit about that, you know, why that's difficult, things like that?"
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,I think there's a lot of food around.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,There are 15 of us in these three cabins.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"And everybody's bringing food, and they're finding farmer's markets and baked treats and things."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"And I just find myself, oh, there's a whoopie pie."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"They're these, like, cream pies that they have all over the place."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"And I, you know, I ate one yesterday and one today, and I'm like, oh, my God."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"Oh, my God."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,It's just so easy to snack.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"And, you know, because I'm on vacation, I'm not really thinking like when I'm at work when I'm –"
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"And when I'm at home, it's like, you know, now it's breakfast time and now it's lunch time and now it's dinner time and maybe a snack."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"Now I'm like, you know, it's vacation."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,I have no set agenda.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"So I'm just kind of, I've caught myself snacking on things I normally don't."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"I don't even really like that much, like cakes and stuff like that."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"But since they're around, I'm eating them."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"So, yeah, I think I'm done with the whoopie pies."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"But I've got to keep – I've got to be very cognizant of am I eating just because I'm snacky or, you know, am I even hungry?"
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"Yes, exactly."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"And that's actually very good insight, you know, before –"
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"you know, picking up that food, whatever it may be, you know, stopping for a minute and really evaluating why you're eating that food."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,Is it really because you're actually hungry and you do want that?
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"Or is it just because, you know, the situation that you're in, like you said, you're out of your normal routine, so it may feel like, you know,"
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"It's not as rigid, not as structured, so you don't feel the need, you know, to make better choices."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"But, you know, being surrounded by all these people, all that food, it may trigger something."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"You know, just cheating here once in a while."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"So, yeah, definitely stopping and kind of asking if you really need that, you know, that's definitely helpful."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,"Are there kind of set, like, meal times, you know, while you're here, or is it kind of just grazing all day?"
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"Really, it's breakfast and dinner are the two set ones."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,Usually breakfast as soon as I get up.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"It's earlier for me than normal, between 7 and 8 a.m."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,And then dinner somewhere around 6 or 7.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,And the burgers have been pretty healthy.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"I put in some food today that I really overestimated, so I'm going to have to adjust that."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,"Like the gyro I got, there's a gyro stand here."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"I ate half of it, and it was mostly salad and a little bit of meat, so it wasn't like one of those crazy euros you get at a fast food place."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,So I haven't gone over quite as much as I had anticipated I did.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"And that said, I'll reduce my dinner by maybe having a salad or something, if anything."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,"Yeah, and, you know, I was going to say, just looking at your tracking in general, you know, nothing too outrageous."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,"Generally, you know, maybe like 1,600 or so, which is, you know, just 100 calories over your goal."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"So not, like I said, not too bad."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,"And we are seeing that weight loss, so something is definitely working."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"Do you feel like there was anything that really kind of pushed you towards that weight loss, like anything that really worked this past week?"
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"Honestly, I think your advice of not trying to attack everything at once."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"That, I think, really hit a string."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"Like, it really resonated and made sense to me."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,Now the next thing I have to do is the portion control.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,And the sacraments.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,"You know, like, I'm still just shocked and appalled at how much fat."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,"I love, I guess I love salty and savory foods and how I am."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,I'm just totally unconsciously eating them.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,"So, yeah, that's the next thing I've got to do."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,really pay attention to.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,"But, yeah, that Todd increments, the increments exercise is really helpful."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,Great to hear.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,So you were randomized to start receiving those text messages.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,So have you been getting those?
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"I haven't gotten one other than the, you know, weigh-in."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,121,advisor,"Then for that next call, if you could go ahead, read lesson four."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,That one is called Making Smart Food Choices.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,And then what would you like your smart goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,I would like to reduce my fat grams at least four days to not go over.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,"And then for our call next week, when is a good day and time for you to talk?"
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,128,patient,Wednesday.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,I'm pretty free all day.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,"Around lunchtime would be the best, but if it has to be earlier or later, that's fine."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,Lunchtime works for me as well.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,"I could do 12, 12.30, 1, 1.30."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,It's pretty open.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,135,advisor,Let's do 12.30.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,136,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,137,advisor,"Yeah, that's perfect."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,138,advisor,Excellent.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,"All right, so then that's going to be the 26 at 12.30."
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,140,advisor,I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,141,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,142,advisor,Thank you.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,You too.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,146,patient,Thanks.
Margaret/6052.F.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,147,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week four."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Were you able to get to lesson four, making smart food choices?"
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,What did you think of that lesson?
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Oh, I thought it was helpful."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"A lot of it I felt I knew, but it was a good reminder."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"I also liked the list of, like, high-fat words versus low-fat words, ways to make yourself feel full without increasing fat."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"calorie, your alcohol intake, the soups and things."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"And then let's see, your previous SMART goals."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,So you had said you wanted to not go over your fat grams at least four of the days of the week.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,So let's go ahead and take a look at your data.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories six out of the seven days."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,It looks like you met your calorie goal two of those days and then your fat gram goal one
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"Okay, right, yeah."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,Go ahead.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"No, there were a couple of days that I exceeded my SAT goal, but it was in the single or low double digits."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"I felt I was making progress, but I didn't quite hit it."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"Yeah, so let's talk a little bit about, you know, your goals."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"What do you feel like is, you know, most challenging for you?"
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"Yeah, again, the fat gram definitely."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"But that said, I was also realizing that a couple of the foods that I'd entered myself as custom foods, because I couldn't find them in the list, I had actually entered the calories, fat calories, instead of fat grams."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"So, I mean, this past week that wouldn't have affected, but previous weeks the fat grams would have been a little lower than I had anticipated."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"Yeah, I'm trying to think of other challenges."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"Part of it, again, was being on vacation."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,It was just so easy.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"We end up eating out more often than I had planned on, and I had a hard time not only finding things on the menu, but when you're eating out, it's hard to say, well, this isn't a treat."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,You know what I mean?
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"If you're going to go out and spend money on food, you want it to be something that you want."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"So I was like, well, I could go for the salad, but I really want the burger, you know."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"If I'm going to get the burger, then I'm going to get the fries."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,And I had a hard time.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,I really did have a hard time making that good decision when I was eating out.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Yes, I can definitely understand that."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"So, you know, those situations are kind of unique since it's not, you know, your daily routine."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Is there anything, you know, that you do regularly that you find is being challenging?"
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,Not really.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"I mean, in my normal day-to-day, I don't seem to have as much of a problem sticking to diet."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"Like, you know, I've actually weeded out a lot of the junk foods and the fried foods that I love."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,I have been able to kind of
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,wean myself off of most of those.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"I'm also limiting my alcohol intake to about one glass a day, and I'm trying to skip a couple of days with the alcohol."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,So that's also decreased the calories.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"And I just kind of feel like if I'm kind of implementing these changes little by little, that it just makes it easier than trying to do all of it at once."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"Yes, of course, you know, taking it one step at a time is definitely going to be easier than, you know, just, like you said, doing it all at once."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Okay, so then I'm guessing a lot of the data that I'm looking at right now might be when you were still on vacation."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"You know, I just want to make sure that, you know, now that it's been about a month that you're in the study, you know, there isn't something that you feel like you're really struggling with that maybe we could talk about."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"Well, food-wise, not so much."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Exercise, I'm still..."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,trying to literally get off my butt.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"And I keep... When I was reading, I reread last week's lessons, and I thought that was actually helpful, like what my barriers are for getting off my butt and motivating myself to work out, doing things like we talked about in smaller increments, and lack of time, like the whole..."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"My biggest barrier, I think, with all of it is the procrastination."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,That's much with the food.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,I kind of see that as a challenge and a really doable intellectual challenge almost.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"Like, how can I meet my food goals?"
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"But when it comes to physical activity, I keep procrastinating."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"Like, I can do it later."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,I'll do it at lunch.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,I'll do it after work.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,I'm too tired.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"I'll do it, you know."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,So I'd keep putting it off until the next day and then the next day.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"On vacation, it was actually super easy because I was hiking and walking and swimming and yachting, or not yachting, kayaking, moving all over the place."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Yeah, so I know that you had brought this up on one of the previous calls, but after doing the activity in that lesson and reading over that again, have you been able to come up with any ideas that will help you push past those barriers?"
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"I'm trying to... Well, I've got a gym membership very close to work, so I did talk to a couple of people at work who actually go on their lunch breaks to the gym because it's walking distance."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,So I am finishing up.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"I'm in a book club, and I've been using my lunches to read a book."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"This book club ends on Saturday, and I'm hoping to..."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,actually finish the book either tonight or tomorrow night and start going to lunchtime fitness sessions at lunch on Friday.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"Oh, wonderful."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,That's awesome.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"And, yeah, despite, you know, those barriers, it still looks like this week you met your 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,You did 340 minutes total.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,"Oh, geez."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"Still doing well, you know, despite all those challenges."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"But I know to consistently keep that up, you know, you have to keep constantly motivating yourself, think of new things so I can understand, you know, there needs to be a little bit of creativity there."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 193.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,So that's a pound down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"So still losing weight, you know, despite all the barriers, still doing very well."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,Cool.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or anything that you wanted
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,I was really happy to see that I lost weight after vacation.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,I've never done that before.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,So I was really happy about that.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,I also want to – I think I guess this might be a SMART goal.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"I would like to – right now I'm going to the Chicago stop, for example, when I leave work."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,I take the Chicago red line and I transfer to the brown line.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,So what I'm planning on doing is –
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"Every day, either getting on at the Brown Line in Chicago, which is a little further down, several blocks further down, or getting off at Irving, which is a stop earlier than where I normally get off and walking a little bit further."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,"Yeah, especially, you know, do that while the weather is nice."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"That's definitely, you know, getting in some physical activity there."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,And then just go ahead and read Lesson 5 for that next call as well.
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"Let's see, that one is called Navigating Social Queues, Gatherings, and Holidays."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,"So, you know, any vacations, you know, are coming up or dinner parties, things like that, this one is going to be very helpful."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"Okay, and then if this same day and time works for you next week, we can just keep this appointment."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,"Otherwise, do you need to move it by any chance?"
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,"Yeah, no, next week is fine, same time."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,"So then that's going to be next Wednesday, August 2nd at 1230, okay?"
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"Right, yeah."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"All right, then I will talk to you then."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,"Keep up the good work, okay?"
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"Great, thank you."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6052.F.w4.7.26.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Let's see, we are in week 10."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Were you able to get to lesson 10, mindfulness?"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"Yes, I was."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Did you like anything that that lesson brought up?
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I did.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"I mean, I felt like that lesson was, you know, really kind of tailor-made for me."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"That was, that's like exactly what I need to be doing and what I'm"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"kind of still struggling with to just be mindful and keep my own, you know, goals and priorities at the forefront."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"So I definitely was, you know, I felt like that was a very, you know, one that was good for me."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"Yeah, and I know something that we've been talking about a lot recently is, you know, taking more time for yourself and being aware of, you know, what you want once in a while, making sure that you are sticking with your goals, things like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,So you had set that SMART goal.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Just trying to make more time for yourself so you can, you know, kind of focus on what you want to get out of this study."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Also, you know, commit yourself, things like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"Um, well, you know, it feels like it's always something."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"Like, I felt like I was going, you know, pretty well in that direction, and then I got sick, and I don't know."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"You know, sometimes it feels like, well, when you do slow down, it's like..."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"Oh, okay, so now I have time to be sick."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"I was, you know, pushing it off before, so that's a little discouraging."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"You know, on the other hand, I guess it's like it doesn't change anything."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,I know what I have to do.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,It's just a matter of doing it.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"You know, speaking of that, there are, of course, you know, a lot of things that we are asking you to do, but, you know, kind of at this point, what do you feel like is within your capacity, you know, to actually do and, you know, to really commit yourself to, you know, for the remainder of the time in the study?"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"Well, I guess to, you know, continue to record everything and, you know,"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"do the weigh-ins and just kind of, you know, renew my intention to prioritize."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Yeah, so, you know, what I'm really trying to get at here is, you know, although this is a one-year-long study, and you definitely belong"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"long process, so we don't really, you know, there isn't a huge amount of pressure on you, you know, to really overhaul your entire lifestyle in just, you know, this first 12-week period."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"However, you know, this is where I am available to help you, and we can also, you know, problem-solve anything."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"So you are in week 10, so I kind of just wanted to ask, you know, what you really want to focus on for these next two or so more weeks before that three-month intervention, or three-month assessment."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,I think really the same as last week.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"You know, to be mindful and prioritize."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Yeah, so I just want to get a little more concrete."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"What do you mean when you say, you know, be mindful and prioritize?"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"Um, that, you know, to just, uh, kind of write out my plans and stick to them and not, you know, always be kind of swayed by what other people are doing, what other people need, what other people, you know, uh, want and just kind of, um, you know, barring a crisis, uh, just kind of sticking with"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"you know, writing out and sticking with my plans for the day."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Then let's go ahead and go over your data.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,It's been nine days since we last talked.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So over these past nine days, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories seven of those days."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,And then it looks like you met your calorie goal one of those days and your fat gram goal four of those days.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"So how was it, you know, this past week with trying to kind of navigate the holiday weekend, being sick, things like that?"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"Yeah, it was pretty tough."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"I mean, I didn't, you know, I really didn't prioritize and just kind of found myself, like, at the end of the day, just recording things and didn't, you know,"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"I wasn't able to, or I didn't, you know, choose things and plan things out at the beginning, or the day before."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Yeah, so, not that weird."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"And then, oh, I was just going to say, and then when I was feeling like, okay, well, but, you know, the holiday weekend's over, then I was feeling sick, so then I was like, ah, I don't want to do anything, you know, I don't"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,wasn't so good either yeah so I was we are in a new week now so you know new new days and new opportunities to kind of get back on track yeah so thinking about this week um kind of what is your plan of action or what are you thinking of doing in terms to kind of get back on track well I I am going to um
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"you know, probably see the doctor later today and kind of focus on just writing out certain things that really need to be accomplished and then, you know, trying to leave more time for rest and getting better and maybe more gentle exercise like walking and"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Um, yoga."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"Um, I haven't been making it to my yoga class in the last couple weeks, and I, that's, you know, I feel a lot better when I'm doing that, so."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"Um, so I want to focus on that."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"Of the calorie goals and kind of your eating habits, what about those?"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Do you feel like there's a certain thing that you want to maybe change or improve upon?
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"Yeah, I feel like I really want to just cut way down on the sugar."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,And that's something I've been saying for a while and not doing much.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"But that is, I feel like that is definitely the thing that's kind of holding me back from weight loss."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"Yes, and then..."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"Let's see, physical activity across five days."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"I saw you did 255 minutes, so you did hit your 240-minute goal last week."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,And your goal this week is 285.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Do you feel like that's feasible?
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,I hope it will be.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"You know, the last three or four days I really haven't exercised because I have been feeling sick, so..."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"But, you know, I'm hoping that tomorrow I'll be feeling up to exercising."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"Yeah, and like you said, just doing light activity."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"Yeah, not pushing too hard."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Most recent weight, I see 216."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"Alright, so it definitely sounds like you have a lot on your mind right now, and definitely a lot of things that you want to put into action."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"You know, maybe prioritizing those, which one is the most important to you, and then when you feel like you've mastered that, moving on to the next one."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"So for this week, you definitely said you wanted to prioritize your time again, right?"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"So writing out your plans and kind of sticking to them, is that correct?"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,So do you want to set that as your SMART goal?
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"Yes, definitely."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"Okay, and then let's see."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,Are you still receiving those in-app text messages from us?
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"Then for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 11."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"And then for our call next week, do you have a preferred day and time that you would like to speak?"
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,I think the Tuesday 1.30 would be good.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,Back to that.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"Yeah, no problem."

Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"Thanks so much, Margaret."
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w10.9.7.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,"All right, so we are in week 11."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"I'll just remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Were you able to get to lesson 11?
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"Yes, I was."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"All right, and then what did you think of that one?"
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I thought it was good.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"I, you know, probably it would have been..."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,better had I read it earlier in the week because I was getting into negative uh thought patterns and yeah just getting you know kind of discouraged so I I just read it yesterday and I was thinking you know I printed it out and some of the you know things to say and I I feel like I'm
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"I'm trying to use that, and it kind of helps me to have it written down."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"But, you know, definitely something that I need to keep in mind."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"Okay, then let's see."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Your previous SMART goal...
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"We're still talking about taking time out for yourself, making sure that you prioritize what you want to do, things like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,So how did that go this past week?
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,It didn't go very well.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,I just seemed to get too caught up in other stuff that's going on.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"I'm still feeling a little... I was feeling better, and then I think I kind of overdid it."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"Now I'm still feeling a little bit of the effects of allergies or, you know, sinus, whatever it is."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,So that's been kind of hard.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"But, so, I guess, yeah, I've just kind of fallen into..."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"feeling kind of negative about it and just, you know."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,But trying to get out of that.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Yeah, it's not easy, right?"
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"Well, I know that that is something that, you know, you want to work on, and it's, you know, all this is definitely, you know, a lot, and it can be very discouraging, I think, at points when you feel like, you know, you're not achieving what you would like to achieve."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"But, you know, it's small wins, I guess, in these kinds of situations that you really need to focus on."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Yeah, so that's actually two pounds down from the last time we checked in."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"You know, whether this is normal fluctuation or, you know, something else, we will kind of see the next time we talk."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"But definitely looks like, you know, the calories got quite high this past week, and I think that's something that, you know, although we only have two weeks left, you know, for this initial part, while I'm still coaching you, I definitely think it could be worthwhile if we still pay attention to that."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"So kind of thinking about this week, trying to get back on track, what were you thinking of doing?"
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"Well, I think my goal would be to, you know, as I said, I printed out the kind of reminders about when I am getting discouraged and just taking time to write."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"in the morning and, you know, keeping a little notebook with me throughout the day and just trying to just get back to my health goals and that way just keep kind of writing about how I'm feeling and, you know, why I'm"
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"thinking like, oh, forget it, you know, it's not going to work, or, you know, just kind of dealing with that and trying to get back, you know, some positive attitudes toward it and feeling like I can do it, you know."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Then let's see, with the text messages, just want to check in on that briefly."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Are you still receiving those?
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"Then for our next call, which will be our last, if you go ahead and read Lesson 12, that one is called Weight Loss Plateau."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"And then just briefly, like in a few words, what would you like to see for the next week?"
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,To record my
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,my feelings.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"Yeah, a few words."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"And let's say to keep a journal, to keep up with my journaling."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"And Margaret, I was going to say, I don't know if I need to speak to you or to the"
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"you know, just reply online."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"But I had, when I was contacted to reschedule my appointment for the three-month check-in, I had scheduled it for Wednesday the 27th, and I realized I will be in New York that week."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Can I reschedule with you for the following week?
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"Yeah, I can go ahead and do that."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,What day would you like to come in?
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"If there is Wednesday, you know, about that same time, but the following week, that would be great."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"Yeah, that should be fine."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"So that's going to be October 4th at 2, correct?"
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"And then when that date approaches, you'll probably receive another reminder email about that, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,That's great.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,Thanks so much.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"So our call next week, the 19th, that's going to be at 1 p.m."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"Yeah, that's perfect."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Just to let you know, this call might be a little bit longer than normal just because, you know, we are wrapping up with the coaching calls, but we kind of just want to talk about, you know, a few things that you learned through the study and kind of how to continue things like that, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,So I just wanted to make you aware.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,Sounds good.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Thanks, Margaret."
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,You too.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w11.9.12.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,"My daughter and I were taking a walk, and we just timed it right."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,1,patient,"There's a bench here with some shade, so that works out."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Okay, so we are in week three of the study."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"I wanted to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"Generally, the way these calls work, they pretty much follow a similar format."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,"On a normal call, I would be asking you about the lesson that I asked you to read the previous week."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"We would go over your SMART goal, which I'll talk about that in just a minute."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"Then we'll go over all of your data and your goals, talk about your most recent weight, and then we would set your next SMART goal for the next call."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"By any chance, have you been keeping up with those lessons?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"No, I have not been able to find them."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"You know, when I'm in the app, I click where I thought they would be, and they weren't."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,So that was one thing I was anxious to talk to you about.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Yeah, that's strange."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"So first, when you go into the app on the home page, if you look at the top left, there's a gear."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,You would click that and then scroll down.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,It should say smart lessons.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"Yes, and that's what I did."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"And when I do, nothing comes up."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,No.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,Did you try entering the URL in a browser and accessing it that way?
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"No, I could try that."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"I'll go ahead and send you the URL for that website, and then I'll also tell you your login information one more time, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"All right, then we can go ahead and start going over your data."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"Before we do that, just in general, kind of want to ask you how it's been trying to meet the goals, what your experience has been like so far."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Well, I am having a harder time than I thought."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"The first week seemed to go pretty well, although I felt..."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"I don't know if it was because I wasn't, you know, eating as much or not eating as much sugar, but I was feeling really emotional."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,A lot of things were coming up.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"And then the second week, I had a harder time, you know, sticking to the number of calories that I needed to be."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Yeah, so..."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Looking at this past week's worth of data, let's see."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all, or six out of the seven days."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,So that's good.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Remember, we really encourage people to eat at least 1,000 calories every day."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,We just know that you have a good number to keep your body going.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"It won't crash, anything like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Then out of these six days, it doesn't quite look like you met your calorie goal any of the days."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,And then you met your fat gram goal one of the days.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So kind of thinking about this past week, let's try to target something in particular that might be, especially you feel like might be challenging for you."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"Well, I was thinking today that maybe, you know, having just the calories, you"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"is difficult for me, and I was thinking I should maybe try to plan out, you know, just make a meal plan that I stick to, you know?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"With most people, they definitely find kind of pre, it doesn't even have to be complete meal prepping, just kind of having a basic idea of what you're going to eat and entering some things into the app is a lot better than just kind of eating something and then entering it into the app and then finding out that maybe it was way more than what you"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,Right.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"At least, let's see, looking at the food that you've been entering, you know, your choices of foods are pretty healthy, actually, so that doesn't seem to be the problem."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Maybe it's just the quantity, would you agree?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"Yeah, the quantity is definitely a problem."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Yeah, so I definitely, like I said, I think planning that out would be helpful."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,We can kind of do that as a first step so we can kind of see maybe areas that need to be improved and then we can kind of go from there.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"In terms of the calories and fat grams, which do you feel like is more difficult for you to meet right now?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,Probably the calories.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"You know, again, I think a lot of the fat grams that I get tend to be from avocados and nuts and things like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"I mean, I know we still need to, you know, stick to it, but I think it's the calories that are more challenging for me."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"Yeah, so, again, with the meal planning, that'll definitely, those will definitely go down."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"And then, of course, the fat grams will follow."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"Right now, you know, the number that you're eating at isn't outrageous or anything."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"You know, your goal is 1,500."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"I see most days it looks like you're around maybe like 1,700."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"So maybe if you're cutting down a bit here and there, we should definitely see some improvement."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,65,unknown,Uh-huh.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"Let's see, with your physical activity, let's see, last week I saw three days recorded."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"You did a total of 92 minutes, so you did meet that 60-minute goal last week."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,And then I wanted to let you know this week your goal did bump up.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Did you happen to see that in the app?
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"I did, yeah."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"And the one thing with that, I still have not been able to find the, you know, the attachment for the Fitbit that helps, you know, so that you can clip it on."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,Right.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"So I've been, you know, keeping it in my pocket and things like that, and that is a little awkward because, you know, a lot of the, like..."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"With spine training or yoga or something, it's kind of hard for me to keep it really in a pocket."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Right, yes."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,I did let my coordinator know.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"With a research study, whenever you create a research study, there are some things that you have to detail to people about how things are going to work out."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"To be honest, this wasn't one of the things that we had actually accounted for, so I know it's been a while since we talked about that."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,We're still kind of trying to figure out how to get that to you.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"But I'll definitely keep you updated on that, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,That sounds good.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,"Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about, any of your goals on this call?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"I'm just wondering, do you have any, like, food plans that you recommend, or is it still better to just, for me to just try to, you know..."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"So generally, in terms of the scope of the study, we don't recommend food plans just because we do want people to build, you know, their own autonomy, figuring out what works for them and what doesn't."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"Of course, you know, if throughout these calls, you know, you still express frustration, then at that point, of course, I'll, you know, be more than happy to talk about some options with you."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"But I definitely think if you take a look at the lessons, you know, those offer some insight as well."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,"And then, like I said,"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,Additional tips.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,I can go ahead and give you those.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,Great.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,And then most recent weight I'm seeing is 218.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,And then I wanted to ask about those text messages.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,Have you been receiving those?
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,"No, I have not."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,Do you have your notifications turned on in the app?
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,I...
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,think so.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,I'll check.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,But I thought that I was initially in the study with the app only.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,"Oh, but that includes text messages?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,"You know, there are those two initial ones and then the three additional components."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,You could either receive one of those or a combination of those additional components.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,That's why you are now receiving both texts and coaching calls.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"So, yeah, I have not."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,"I've been checking messages, but I haven't in the app, but I haven't gotten them."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,"I will go ahead and check up on those, but thank you for letting me know."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,and talk about our next call.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,"So, again, please read the lessons I'm going to assign."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,"Lesson two, that is called healthy eating, and then lesson four, making smart food choices, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,128,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,And should I read the other ones from before that I didn't get?
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,"As well, or?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,"If you want to, you can."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,I think just so that we're caught up and what I'll be asking you about on our next call are two and four.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,"Two and four, okay."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,134,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,135,advisor,Then we can go ahead and set your first SMART goal.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,136,advisor,So have you ever heard of SMART goal setting?
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,"Yes, I have."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,138,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,140,advisor,"So, you know, this is just something that we'll be doing on every call."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,141,advisor,"We kind of want to make a focused effort on trying to improve some behaviorally-based goal that you feel like would help you, you know, achieve this larger goal of, you know, getting healthier, losing weight, things like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,142,unknown,Did you kind of have an idea of what you'd like that to be?
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,143,patient,"Well, I think it would be to..."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,144,patient,Plan out my each day's food the night before.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,146,advisor,"Do you want to say, you know, planning out every single meal, or do you want to just say at this point maybe planning out at least one meal out of the day?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,147,patient,I think I'd like to do all.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,148,patient,That's okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,149,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,150,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,151,advisor,"Great, and then on our next call, I'll just be asking about how that went, OK?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,152,advisor,OK.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,153,advisor,"OK, great."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,154,advisor,Then we can go ahead and set up a time for our next call sometime next week.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,155,advisor,Do you have a preferred day and time?
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,156,patient,This time is good.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,157,patient,"1.30 on Tuesday, is that?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,158,advisor,"Yep, that works for me."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,159,advisor,"So I will put you down next Tuesday is the 25th, and then I'll be down for 1.30, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,160,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,161,advisor,"All right, great."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,162,advisor,"It was great talking to you, Carol, and then I will check in with you next week, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,163,patient,"Okay, thanks a lot, Margaret."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,164,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6058.A.w3.7.18.17.MD.MP3,165,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, we are officially in week four of the study."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Like always, we'll be going over your lessons, Merkle, data, and then I'll ask you about your text messages."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,So I asked you to read lessons two and four.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to those?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yes, I was."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,They were good.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I liked the activity in Lesson 4.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"I found that helpful to, you know, prepare."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"And, yeah, I thought, you know, the information was good."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"So you had mentioned that Lesson 4, you liked how it talked about the physical activity."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Can you kind of explain that to me a little bit?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"Well, just the, you know, the idea of planning out and, you know, taking your time to plan out the"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,the day's activities.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,I'm trying to remember now.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,I don't have it in front of me.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Is it difficult trying to get in physical activity?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"Well, I've been able to do it."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"It's just that, you know, I guess with everything, there's so many things going on that sometimes the"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"The timing, you know, I will end up, you know, if I don't plan it out the day before, it's easy for the day to get away from me."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Yeah, exactly."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"I think a lot of people find that, you know, putting it into their schedule, treating it kind of like a meeting, you know, definitely helps to make sure that they get that physical activity in regularly instead of, like you said, maybe pushing it off just because it may not seem as important as everything else."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,So glad you were able to take something away from that.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"Let's see, your previous SMART goal, you had said you want to pre-plan all of your meals."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,So how did that go?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Yeah, it went pretty well."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"I pre-planned not all, but at least something every day."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,So I wrote down
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"you know, the night before."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,And so I guess I should say I did pre-plan all the meals every day.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,I didn't always follow through with what I pre-planned.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"But more often than not, I did."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"You know, but there were a few days that I, you know, would end up having something that was not on the plan."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Yeah, so good, you know, that you're getting into the habit"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,just following through when you can.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"But of course, we recognize that it's not gonna happen all the time, but just doing your best with that."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and go over your data."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"So remember, whenever I go over any data, we're always going over the past week."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,So I'm looking at from July 17th to July 23rd.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"So over this one week period, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories two of the days."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,So recording is a little bit spotty.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,Can you kind of tell me what's going on there?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"Oh, no, I did record."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"You're saying that the data only came in that, for two of the days?"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"I'm seeing two days where you record at least 1,000, three days total."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"No, I mean, I recorded every day."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,In the smart app.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"Is that, is it coming through?"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,I wonder if there's... Do you have your phone in front of you?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,Can you go ahead and open up the smart app and just go into that nutrition window?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,So remember clicking view?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,And then you see the calendar at the top.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"Can you go ahead and click on last Monday, the 17th for me?"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,Hold on a second.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,61,unknown,.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,I don't know what happened because I was definitely recording it every day.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"Um, you know, sometimes things happen."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"Just, you know, whenever you're adding, are you making sure to click, you know, the save button, you know, done, things like that?"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"God, I don't know."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,I'm really surprised.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"I didn't, oh."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"I, maybe I was not."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,It's okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,you know while it's good for us for data is also you know mostly for you just so you can keep yourself accountable you know also keeping yourself on track so it's not you know the end of the world or anything like that um i just kind of wanted to point it out unless um since if you were having like tech issues or anything like that we could get that solved but again uh not a big deal okay i'm sorry no
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"So looking at just these two days, you know, I didn't see that you met the calorie goal any of the days, but I saw that you did meet your fat gram goal one of those days."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"But just in general, since I'm not, I guess I'm not seeing everything, how has it been trying to meet the goals?"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"It's been, again, a challenge."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"It seems that during the day when I'm busy and everything, it's fine."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,And then in the evening is when I would tend to go over.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"And that would be when I, you know, would have something that I hadn't planned out before."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"You know, whether it's like a second glass of wine or, you know, a dessert or something like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"So that would be... So at least you've, you know, identified situations in which there may need some improvement."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,Do you feel like in those situations in particular it would be better to kind of substitute foods or do you think maybe eliminating those foods altogether would be most helpful?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"Um, probably eliminating would be the best."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"So, you know, with that, of course, if it's going to be, you know, in your household, there's always going to be that temptation, of course, to reach for those foods."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"So usually what we would just say, you know, out of sight, out of mind kind of thing."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"If you don't want, you know, even the option of it being there, it's just best, you know, not to buy it altogether."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,Does that kind of make sense?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"Oh, yeah."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,Um.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"I do have, you know, adult children who tend to buy different things."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"So, you know, it's not possible to completely, but I think for the most part."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,"Yeah, no problem."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,Are they aware that you're in this program?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"Yeah, and they are."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"Usually helpful, but, you know."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,"Right, right."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"Well, you know, one thing that we always say, you know, if they are aware and, you know, maybe they're not, although they might be aware that, you know, you're in this program trying to, you know, make some behavior change, things like that, they might not know that there are specific things that are, you know, very tempting to you."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,"So if you feel comfortable letting them know that maybe keeping some wine out of reach, they can still buy it, but maybe putting it somewhere else where you can get to it as easily, things like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"I know it sounds kind of ridiculous, but it really does help in the long run just trying to cut down on those temptations."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,"Oh, yeah."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,"No, I agree."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,"Physical activity last week, I saw three days recorded."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,You did a total of 170 minutes.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,Does that sound accurate?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"Is all that coming through, do you feel like?"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,"Yeah, that's probably coming through."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,"All right, and then most recent weight I see is 215."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,"Okay, so that's actually three pounds down from the last week."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"Yeah, yeah, so I was really happy about that."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"Yeah, a little bit faster than we'd like, but, you know, not too bad."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,"So it looks like definitely something that you're doing is working, so that's great."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,Do you feel like there was something that made a big difference this past week in terms of that weight loss?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,The planning out.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,Definitely.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,Definitely.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,"All right, so I'm going to go ahead and ask you about the text messages."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,So have you been receiving those from us?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,"Yes, I have."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,"All right, then, is there anything else that you'd like to talk about on this call or anything you want to bring up?"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,128,patient,I don't think so.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,"All right, yeah, like I said, you know, just keeping up with what you're doing."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,"I definitely think the meal prepping is paying off, so, you know, I would suggest continuing with that."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,"So for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 5."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,"That one is called Navigating Social Cues, Gatherings, and Holidays."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,134,advisor,We can go ahead and set your SMART goal.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,135,advisor,So did you kind of have an idea in mind of what you'd like that to be for this week?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,"I guess, you know, I would like to –"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,"Well, continue with the planning and then maybe, you know, stick to it all the time."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,"I guess, you know, maybe the planning in terms of exercise and food."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,139,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,140,patient,"So that I, you know, really have a plan for the day and that that is kind of at the top of the priority list."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,141,advisor,"All right, great."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,142,advisor,"Okay, then for our call next time, does this time generally work or would you like to move it to a different day and time?"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,143,patient,"No, this time works for me."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,"So then that's going to be next Tuesday, August 1st at 1.30."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,146,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,147,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,148,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,149,advisor,"All right, then I will talk to you then."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,150,advisor,"Like I said, just keep up the good work, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,151,patient,"Okay, thanks a lot, Margaret."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,152,advisor,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6058.A.w4.7.25.17.MD.MP3,153,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,We are in week seven of this study.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Then I just wanted to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to lesson six?
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yes, I did."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,And what did you think of that one?
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,It was helpful.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,Let me think.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,I'm trying to remember.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"Sorry, it's just been a hectic day."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,What was the theme?
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,It was called Ways to Stay Motivated.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"So it was just talking about why you joined the study, things like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"Right, yeah."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"It was good timing because I don't know if it was so much like I felt like I was losing my motivation exactly, but I was feeling kind of discouraged because I feel like I kind of, you know,"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"two steps forward, two steps back kind of thing."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,So I don't know.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"I feel like I... I just... I need to really focus on it and, again, maybe, you know, take another step to simplify things for myself."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"You know, you're losing weight, but what do you, like, what are you kind of most frustrated by?"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"Well, I'm not, I mean, I'm sort of at the same, I think I'm ending up at kind of the same way."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,It's like I'm going up and down.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,couple of pounds but then I'm you know what I mean so overall I don't think I'm really making much progress okay do you so maybe the weight loss isn't coming at the rate that you would like it to but can you identify other areas where you feel like you might have improved so do you feel like you're you know eating healthier do you feel like you're doing more physical activity anything like that
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"Yeah, I'm definitely doing more physical activity."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"I'm at least more aware of portion sizes, even if I'm not always adhering to the ones that I should have."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,I am definitely more aware of that.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,And I'm...
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,Normally a pretty healthy eater.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"In general, I just tend to eat too, you know, large portions and sugar, you know."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"I feel like I really should just cut it out completely, but I haven't really done it yet."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"I hope that you can recognize, though, that there are some habits that you're starting to build up, you know, that over the course of a long time are just going to lead to a healthier body and a healthier lifestyle in general."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Even if that weight, like I said, isn't moving down in the way that you would like it to, you're still on your way towards that."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,You know what I mean?
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Um, let's kind of look at, um, this past week then."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Um, so your previous Markle, you had said you want to be more precise with your food choices, um, just kind of being more mindful."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Um, so kind of how did that go this past week?"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Um, you know, not that well."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"I, um, I mean, I, I was planning out, but I don't know."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"I, you know, again, I, I wasn't,"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"I was making the plans the night before, but then I was not really sticking with my plan."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,I was kind of veering off.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"I seem to do better when I get, you know, like frozen, you know, healthier frozen dinners kind of thing because they're portion controlled and they're,"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"you know, it's just easy."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"So I'm thinking, you know, and I do like to, you know, cook and go to farmer's markets and stuff like that, but I kind of feel like sometimes that just, that may not be the best thing for right now because I think"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,I end up eating too much.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"It's just, it's easier for me if it's just here it is and that's it."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,So I think I need to do that more.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"So at least it sounds like, you know, you've definitely identified what works for you."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"Do you feel like it would be reasonable to say that maybe, you know, one day during this week you go to the grocery store and"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"you know, buy those pre-prepared foods that you need and you kind of consume those throughout the week and kind of see where you end up?"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Yeah, and in fact, I did do that yesterday."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"I went and brought, I mean, I probably need to supplement with a few things, but I have mostly everything for at least a few days."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,But I think that would be a good idea to get some things for...to really try and get everything I need and just kind of take the thought out of it.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,for the most part awesome and hopefully you know when you're consuming those foods it kind of it sounds like you know you did say that you like to cook on your own so it might prompt you to think of some ways you know to create your own dishes you know that are appropriately portioned or kind of have the right ingredients to kind of help you stay on track you know
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"Of course, we know that this isn't easy, but it does sound like you're putting in that effort."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"So, you know, we'll check again next week to kind of see how that's going."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"But to look at your data more specifically, so last week, let's see, from the 8th, August 8th until yesterday, the 14th, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Doesn't...
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,might help you stay within that calorie limit is there anything maybe that you feel like you eat kind of often that you feel like you could kind of cut out yeah i mean it it's you know either uh it seems to be i'll either have a glass of wine or uh
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"a sweet of something, you know, so I'm kind of getting my sugar one way or the other."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"And I feel like if I cut that out, I'd probably be fine."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"And, you know, and it kind of tends to be like, you know, I'm doing well usually during the day and busy, and then at night, you know, either at dinner or"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"Or after dinner, I'm like, well, you know, I'll have this nice healthy meal, but, you know, I'll have some wine and or, you know, some dessert."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"And I feel like that's kind of, you know, not the way to, you know, lose the weight anyway."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"Right, yeah, and I don't think you're the only one, you know, that talks about"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,Or mention something like that.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"It's so easy, you know, especially at the end of the day."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"You know, it's been a long day and you're kind of relaxed at nighttime and you want to have a dessert and a drink."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,That's really common.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"You know, whether it be trying to find some social support that you feel like could help you, if you feel like maybe a family member could kind of help you stay on track."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"Or, you know, just reminding yourself that you are part of a study."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,There is obviously a goal that you want to get out of it.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Finding that own internal motivation to kind of help moving you along.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,But I definitely recognize it's not easy.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,"You know, those are kind of things that have been ingrained in us."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,So breaking out of that long-time habit is not the easiest thing.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"But again, you've identified"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,At least you know it's an area that you need to work on.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,"Fat grams, though, weren't that bad."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,You met those five out of the seven days.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"So it looks like, you know, overall pretty good with the fat grams."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"Physical activity, I saw six days."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,You did a total of 256 minutes.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,So you did meet your 248-minute goal.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,The most recent weight I see is 207.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"No, it isn't."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,And I'm not sure what happened with the scale.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"I don't know if, like, somebody else got on it or, you know, something."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"But, yeah, I mean, it's weird because it did say that when I got it."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"But then I was like, no, I don't think so, you know."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"And then I got back on, and then it was more like, well, 215 or whatever it was."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,And so I'm not really sure how that happened.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,"It seems like it's back to normal now, but I, yeah, I wish that that were the case, but..."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,"Unfortunately, it isn't."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"With some diligence, I'm sure we will get there, so don't worry about that."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,"Yeah, it is kind of strange that I would say that."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"Maybe, you know, it is a machine, so it might have just not had the most accurate reading at the time, but no big deal."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,Just wanted to check in.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,Have you been receiving those in-app text messages from us still?
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,"All right, Carol, is there anything else that you would like to talk about or bring up on this call?"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,"No, I don't think so."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"Yeah, so, you know, quite a few things to think about."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,"You know, at the forefront, I would definitely look at, like you said, the alcohol consumption and the sugar that's"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,"Not only lower your calories, but I think it'll also give you some more room to eat, you know, other foods."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"Right, so there'll be more."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,"Fat grams, you know, you're meeting those five out of the seven days."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,That's very good.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,And then physical activity is on track as well.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,"So just paying a little bit more attention to the calories, and we should see that weight come off, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,"Then for our next call, I'm just going to ask you to read two lessons just so we're all caught up."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,"So Lesson 7 is called Conquering Slip-Ups, and then Lesson 8 is called Food Cravings and Cues."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,"I think to really, you know, replace like the sugar treats with something like a walk or, you know, a swim or something, you know, not necessarily a vigorous exercise, but just something that's kind of"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,"and, you know, to keep me kind of focused."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,137,advisor,"Yeah, do you feel like that's feasible for you to do, you know, because you do say that you've been eating mostly that dinner time, so do you feel like you will be able to, you know, do that?"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,I think so.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,139,patient,"You know, I think it'll be kind of hard, but I feel like, you know, as you were saying earlier,"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,140,patient,"it's a habit that I need to break and I know, you know, to replace it with something else and, you know, make a plan with somebody and say like, you know, oh, let's, you know, walk to, you know, even to Starbucks and get like a sparkling water or something but, you know, like, let's do that at 7.30 in the evening or let's,"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,141,patient,"you know, my sister has a pool, you know, let's go up to your pool and, you know, relax and, you know, something that's kind of a treat that doesn't involve sugar at all."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,142,patient,"Yeah, understandable."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,"Okay, and then for our call next week, so next Tuesday is going to be the 22nd at 1.30."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,145,patient,"Yes, that'll be fine."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,146,advisor,"All right, Carol."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,147,advisor,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,148,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,149,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,150,patient,"Thanks a lot, Margaret."
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,151,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,152,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w7.8.15.17.MD.MP3,153,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week eight of the study."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Let's see here, lesson... Oh, I asked you to read two lessons, seven and eight."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to those?
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"You know, I did not, Margaret."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I'm sorry.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I will do that today.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,It was... Last week was very...
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Patrick, for me, I think I was telling you that I went down for the eclipse, and I was actually out of town most of the week, as it turned out, and so I kind of lost track of things a bit."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,But I will catch up with that this week.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,I'll just go ahead and ask you to read 8 and 9 then.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"You can read 7 on your own time, but so that we're kind of moving along, all right?"
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"All right, let's see here."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Your previous SMART goal.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"So you had said really wanted to avoid those sugary treats, you know, going on a walk or doing something else, you know, some kind of activity to help you avoid those."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,So how did that go?
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"Well, you know, at first, the early part of the week, not so well."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"But actually, you know, the last several days, I guess that's more into this next week."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"But, yeah, so I think, again, with a lot of activities and celebrations and things that were going on,"
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,I didn't really focus on it as I had intended.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"But now for the last few days, I feel like I have actually made progress and started to do exactly that."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"Like in the evening, after dinner, when I would like to have dessert or a glass of wine or something, I take a walk."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,And so that has...
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,that has helped yeah I was gonna say I was looking over your food your food logs and I do see you know a few days where you have been eating you know some gelato things like that so yeah sugary treats so maybe just something that you still want to you know keep up try to do just try to limit that consumption but otherwise good to hear that you're doing well there
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Let's see, looking at your other data, so physical activity last week across three days I saw 106 minutes, so not quite at that 291 minute goal."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Thinking about that, how are you feeling about the physical activity portion?"
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"Well, again, that was actually... I would say I actually did hit the goal but didn't record it because I had..."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"misplaced the Fitbit for a few days and with the travel and, you know, I was driving a lot, but I was doing a lot of, you know, fast walking and biking and things like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,So I actually probably came close to that goal.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,But my recording of things fell apart a little bit last week.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,portion.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"So, I saw five days where you recorded at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,Looks like you met your calorie and fat gram goal one of those days.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,How are you feeling about this week?
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Well, I really am feeling much better, and I, you know, the thing with last week, which..."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"I, you know, hopefully it's good that I kind of knew, you know, at a certain point, I just thought, well, you know, this week is just, you know, very different from my usual week."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"And I just kind of tried to, you know..."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"keep in mind general principles, but knew that it wasn't going to be, you know, exactly what I would plan normally for the study."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"And I'm feeling now, you know, in these last few days, a couple days that I've been back, I do feel actually very good about, you know,"
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"being mindful and, you know, getting my food and my exercise really precisely."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Most recently, I see 217."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,Does that sound correct?
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"Yeah, that was this morning."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,Uh-huh.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"for, you know, these upcoming weeks, especially with the sweets."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,I think eliminating those will definitely help.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"And, you know, with eliminating those, you'll have a lot of room, you know, to eat other foods that you like probably, a lot of calories and fat grams to spare."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,So keep that in mind.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"So for, oh, are you still receiving those in-app text messages?"
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,63,unknown,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"So, yeah, like I said, for our next call, go ahead and read Lessons 8 and 9, and then what would you like your SMART goals to be?"
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,I think to prioritize my own schedule above everybody else's schedule.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,whatever but well because you know I think a lot of times what you know will get in the way of me you know doing you know kind of following things exactly is that I'm thinking of well you know what will the kids have for dinner and what will the you know this one and that one and
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"just getting a little bit, um, you know, overly involved and overly flexible in what other people are doing instead of like, well, you know, whatever else is going on, I'm doing this and this is what I'm doing."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"And, you know, so, um, I don't know if that's clear, but it's, uh,"
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"You know, kind of prioritizing myself and my goals."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Yes, I understand."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"Then for our call next week, when is a good day and time for you to talk?"
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,The Tuesday at 1.30 is fine.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Yes, that's going to be the 29th, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,Then I will talk to you then.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"Thank you, Margaret."
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w8.8.24.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,Let's see here.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,1,patient,We are in week nine.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"Let's see, were you able to get to that lesson?"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yes, I did."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,Great.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,And what did you think of that one?
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,Hello?
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,So I had just asked you what you thought about the lesson.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"I really didn't hear anything that you said, so if you could just repeat that."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"Oh, yeah."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Yes, I found it helpful."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"I was, you know, I feel like sort of all of the lessons kind of go back to what I learned"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"and what I, you know, feel sure about doing."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,It's just the acting isn't always where it needs to be.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"And, you know, I think especially just the idea of"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"you know, just so many things, uh, taking precedence, you know, that I'm, I'm kind of allowing to take precedence over what I need to do."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"And I don't know, just, uh, kind of, um, uh,"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"I feel like I need to really do something, I don't know, drastic might be too strong a word, but like to just carve out the time and space that I need."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Because I really feel like I'd be successful if I were...
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,if I were giving less more time and energy than I have been.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"Yeah, I know that this was something that you had mentioned on our last call."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,It's actually also related to the smart goal that you set.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"You said you want to prioritize some time for yourself, putting yourself first."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"So this sounds like, at least to me, that this is something that's really bothering you."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,you're stretching very thin right now and things are just really hectic for you?
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"And, you know, I feel like I try to, you know, really focus on one thing or another, like, you know, well, okay, at least I'm going to get my sleep or at least I'm going to, you"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"you know, get my exercise in and, you know, I, I have been doing, you know, fairly well with that, but, um, but I somehow, I don't know, it's just with the, the eating, I'm sort of, uh, I don't know, maybe I'm tired of cooking or I don't know."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"I feel like when I get, um,"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"The best that I do in taking care of my calories is when I get like the frozen individual meals and do it that way because it just seems like if I'm cooking or going, you know, it's just too hard to get, to stay within the boundaries that I need to stand."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"Yeah, so, you know, when you are cooking those foods, and, you know, definitely correct me if I'm wrong, but, you know, we generally assume, you know, people have general ideas, you know, about what is healthy, what is not healthy, of course, you know, it's great to eat a lot of vegetables, fruit, you know, things like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,And I'm sure you're aware of that.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Do you feel like that translates well, though, like when you're cooking?"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,Are you like following a recipe?
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,Or you're just kind of how are you going about it?
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Um, well, I think, um, I think for the most part, I, um, you know, I, I have recipes and I, you know, sometimes if I'm trying something new, I'll follow it directly."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"But with a lot of things I know, you know, what I'm doing and I don't want to necessarily follow a recipe exactly, but I, um,"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"and they are usually healthy meals, it's... It's amounts, and it's taking the time to cook them and to be, you know, precise about them, and it's... You know."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Again, I think that when I'm cooking, you know, for my family and for friends and whatever, I just..."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"I tend to focus on, you know, everybody else and what will be nice and what will be fun and, you know, which is good."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"I mean, I know that's obviously that's a part of food in our lives, but I mean, not right now."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"I feel like, you know, I've got to kind of get out of that now and maybe now that summer's over, it might be a little easier."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,I don't know.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,It just seems like
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Every time I turn around, like, someone's coming into town and somebody's doing this."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"You know, there's, well, there's this occasion and all this, you know."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"And I'm, you know, I think maybe I need to just, like, put out an alert to everyone."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"I'm doing this and don't, you know."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,I definitely think what you're saying is making sense.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"And it definitely sounds like, and I think, I remember you had mentioned this very early on when we were talking that, you know, you are the one that cooks in your home and you don't want to, you know, like subject everyone else to what you're doing because this is a decision that you're making, you know, for yourself."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,I do remember this conversation a little bit.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"However, you also have to remember, you know, you are in the study and you're obviously in the study for a reason because you wanted to get something out of it for yourself, you know, to benefit yourself."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"And I think it's not unreasonable, you know, if you feel comfortable letting people in your family know that this is something that's important to you and maybe it might make, you know, there might be some changes, you know, in their diet as well."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"But these are all, you know, these are good things for everyone, not just for yourself."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Well, and I think really I, you know..."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"It is very possible with all my family and friends to just, you know, to be firm about that."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,It's just that I haven't been.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"And I think, you know, I think that I do allow, you know, many other things, work and this and that."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,It's just I get very busy and then I...
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"I'm like, oh, well, you know, they're just coming in today, and I'll make a nice dinner."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"And then I, you know, so it's really not them."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"It's not like anyone is, you know, demanding that I do this, but I am just falling into my usual patterns, and I think it's because I'm not..."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"You know, I'm not planning things out the way I need to be."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,I'm not.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,And not just the food.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Like, I did that, and it was helpful, but I think really what I need to do, especially for these next few weeks, is to really kind of plan out everything around this."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"And, yes, I have to work, and I have this and that, and I have other priorities, but"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"to really say, okay, this is, you know, first thing in the morning, I'm looking at my schedule regarding, you know, with myself and my health and the program in mind, and then everything else, you know."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,So that's what I'm planning to do.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,I think it's great.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"Not a lot of people have a lot of insight, you know, into kind of where they need to improve."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"And I think it's great that, you know, you realize this."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"And, of course, it's not going to be easy."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,You're pretty much asking yourself to kind of change the way that you function a little bit.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"Recognizing it, like I said, is definitely the first step."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,And I'm definitely here to help.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"So if you want to talk about anything, you know, please let me know."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"But, you know, again, it's not easy."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,But just putting a little bit of effort into there can really make that difference.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,So let me just go ahead and briefly go over your data.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"So last week I saw that you recorded 1,000 calories five of the days."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,And then it looks like you met your calorie goal and fat gram goal two of the days.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,"Physical activity, across three days you did 195 minutes."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"So just maybe about one workout shy of your goal, 259 minutes."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,Uh-huh.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,And then I wanted to let you know your fiscal activity goal this week is 240 minutes.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"And then let's see, most recent weight I see is 216."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,Does that sound right?
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"Yeah, that's correct."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,"Yeah, so that is checking in, just maintaining from the last time we checked in."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"So, you know, at this point, I think we're in a pretty good place, you know, to kind of make some good changes here and there."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"So for this upcoming week, kind of where do you want to start?"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"Where do you see yourself, you know, focusing on, you know, trying to improve?"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"I think, you know, as I was saying, which I did actually kind of start,"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"yesterday where, or at least I started the plan, and so far so good, as, you know, really trying to map out the whole day with a view to my diet and exercise and everything coming first."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,So where...
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,"I would have had, like, you know, oh, well, maybe I'll go out with these, you know, people for dinner to be like, well, no, maybe I will have some downtime for myself and, you know, take a walk and just plan out the next day and get my rest and, you know."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,So I think it's kind of like...
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,more time for myself I think in ways that are really because that's the thing too it's like I mean of course you know it's still like yeah I love to eat ice cream and stuff but I think there is a lot of like what I really want to do is eat healthy and exercise and I'm kind of
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"Just letting circumstances, you know, kind of pull me along."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,"So I guess, again, just my goal is to be just very intentional and more time for myself."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,Did you want to repeat that as a SMART goal?
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"Yes, I do."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,And then we'll be checking in on that week.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,"I'm hoping, you know, that there are, you have some opportunity to definitely take some time for yourself."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,"And I know that this, again, is a little more active than some, and definitely involves some other people, but really hoping, you know, that this pans out for you."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,I think it'll be some good change.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,And then have you been receiving those in-app text messages from us?
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,"Then for that next call, if you could go ahead and get to the next lesson."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,"So lesson 10, that one is called mindfulness."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,"So this one is just kind of talking about being aware of the foods that you're putting into your body, kind of slowing down when you're eating, kind of what they talk about, you know, how to eat consciously, mindfully, things like that."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,And then have your smart goal down.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,"And then for our call next week, so next Tuesday is September 5th."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,That's going to be at 1.30.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,"Yeah, that's good."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,"All right, Carol."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,"Have a good week and a great weekend, okay?"
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,"Thanks, Margaret."
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,You too.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,134,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,136,advisor,Talk to you later.
Margaret/6058.A.w9.8.29.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,We are in week four.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"And then I just wanted to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"The last time we talked, I asked you to read lesson three."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Do you happen to remember that one by any chance?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,You know what?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I do not.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Wait.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,No.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,Was lesson three about portion sizes?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,No.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,That one was called adding activity to your day.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,I don't remember.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,I do apologize.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,No.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"Then just for our next call, I'm just going to ask you to read two lessons, okay, just so that we're all caught up."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,Your previous SMART goal.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"So when we last talked, you had mentioned that you were food prepping a lot and you were trying to eat those meals instead of, you know, going out, eating fast food."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,So how has that been going?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,It's been going great.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"I've not been recording, though, but I have been making healthy food choices."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Looking at your data over the past week, so I'm looking at from the 8th, so last Tuesday until yesterday, the 14th, it looks like you recorded at least 1,000 calories only one of the days."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"Didn't quite hit your calorie and fat gram goal any of the days, so..."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Like you said, recording is definitely spotty."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Can you just kind of tell me what's been going on, you know, in general with trying to meet the goals?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"It hasn't been anything around, like, food or weight."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"It's just been general life stuff, lots of stress, lots of change, and just kind of back to school time."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"My son is going to a different – well, my son is actually going to be homeschooling, so just preparing for that, so –"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,That's kind of just been taking up all of my mental load.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Yeah, so kind of how have you been balancing, you know, all of that stress, but also kind of still staying within the parameters of our program, things like that?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Well, stress actually makes me not eat, and it makes me cook."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"So that actually worked out well, because it's just like instead of going to the restaurant and getting a burger, it's like cook some food, right?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"And then with that, I have more control of what I'm eating and the ingredients I'm using."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,So that's a plus.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"And then, let's see, looking at physical activity, I don't see any days or any minutes recorded last week."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,So I know previously you had talked about you had signed up for a boot camp.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Are you still doing that?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"I do that on Saturdays, typically."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,And then I'm actually going to join the gyms.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"You do the boot camp for so long, and then they let you join the gym, and you get a special rate."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,So I was just kind of waiting to get the special rate.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Yeah, I don't see any minutes entered in on my side."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"Like I said, have you been wearing the Fitbit while you're doing those classes?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,I have been wearing the Fitbit.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"I've not been, like, putting it in manually."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,I didn't know.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Everything transfers over, right?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"No, I actually don't see any activity on my side."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Is it showing up in your app?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,In our smart app?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"In the app, no, because I don't put it in manually."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,Does it not transfer from the Fitbit?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,Because I do wear that.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"So even if you don't put it in manually, it should still show up in our app if everything is syncing correctly."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,So that might mean the Fitbit isn't synced up or something had happened.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"Have you, like, been noticing anything with, like, the display or anything like that?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,Uh-uh.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"Okay, can you just go ahead, maybe after this call, just kind of look into that."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Just make sure that, you know, everything is synced up, that the battery doesn't need replacing, something like that."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"And then just shoot me an email, and if there are any issues, we can kind of problem solve that, okay?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,Let's see then.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,Do you happen to have a most recent weight-binding chance?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,I just weighed in this morning.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"I don't see that either, which is strange."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Did that weight show up in the app as well?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,I haven't even checked.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Let me check now.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Let me see if I can check it while I'm on the call.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"Tuesday, 8.15."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,This is not recorded.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"Friday, 8.11."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,It was 2.16 this morning.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,"Yeah, so does it, in the smart app, does it say that the Fitbit Aria is synced?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,Or does it say not synced?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,It says not synced.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,Did anything change?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,"Like, did you get a new phone, or did you have to reset anything?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"I had to reset my Wi-Fi, so that's why I'm thinking it hasn't been recorded yet."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,"Okay, so, yeah, probably because of that, you're going to have to go through the steps and kind of set everything up again since everything is connected to the Wi-Fi."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,"Do you need me to send you a set of setup instructions, or do you still have that packet that I had given you?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,I still have all that.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"Yeah, so just go ahead and follow those steps, and then just let me know if you have any problems."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,That explains so much.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"Thank you so much, Margaret."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"Yeah, of course."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"Okay, otherwise, let's see."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,So we're still kind of hanging in at 216.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,That's where we were when we checked in last time.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"So it sounds like, you know, you've been keeping up with a lot of good, healthy habits."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,"Hopefully, you know, the weight will follow as well."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"I definitely think with a more consistent recording, that will also help since..."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,"The majority of the days you did record under 1,000 calories, so I can't quite tell where you're at in terms of food consumption, things like that."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"So I would just ask that you try to be a little more diligent about that, okay?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,"And then have you been receiving those text messages from us, the in-app notifications?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,"Yes, I have."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,"All right, and then for that next call, if you could go ahead and read lesson four and five, okay?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"Yes, ma'am."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"All right, and then what would you like your SMART goal to be for our next call?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"My SMART goal, I would like to record regularly."
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,"All right, and then let's see, for our call next week,"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,121,advisor,Next Tuesday is going to be the 22nd at 9.30.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,That works.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,You as well.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6063.E.w4.8.15.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,We are in week five.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,We'll be going over our normal agenda.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"So going over that homework, your SMARCLE, and then all of your data."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,So let's see here.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,I asked you to get to lessons four and five.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,Did you happen to read those by any chance?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,I did.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,I really liked lesson five.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,That was interesting to me.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,Why do you say that?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"Just because it involves, like, social cues and the people around you, and that's kind of something that I'm dealing with personally, so I enjoyed reading that."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"All right, then, your previous SMART goal."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"So we had really talked about recording regularly, you know, hitting those or at least recording 1,000 calories every day, just being consistent."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,So how did that go this past week?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"I did really well, even if I had to go back and record at the end of the day, I did really well around doing that."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,So let's see here.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Looking at your data, so the past week I am looking at from the 15th to yesterday, the 21st."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"So looking at this seven-day period, it looks like you recorded at least 1,000 calories two of the days."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,So does that sound accurate?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,That does.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Then out of these two days, it looks like you hit your calorie both of those days."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Didn't quite hit your fat gram goal any of the days, so."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Um, still, you know, a little bit of spotty recording, um, kind of what do you feel like is your biggest barrier to entering those foods into the app?"
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"Um, I'm not even, I really have not been eating that often."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,I've been working a lot.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"So the food that's in the app, that's, that's what I eat for the day."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"I'm generally only having, well, last week I was only eating one meal typically and snacking."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Are you not feeling, you know, any hunger or anything like that, even though you're eating such a little amount?"
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"Yeah, I'm not feeling hungry."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"And I'm working a lot, and I work in my car, so I'm driving a lot, or I'm at home on the computer, and I'm just kind of sitting there and kind of distracted by other things."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Yeah, so I understand maybe you're not feeling that hunger, of course."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,That's going to lead you to not want to eat.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"However, it's really important that you do feed your body that energy that it needs."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"It's important not only to keep your metabolism up, but also your body needs energy to just function."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"Even if you're not physically exerting yourself, things that go on inside the body, general energy also,"
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"You know, just towards your overall health in general, it's really important that you do eat a certain amount."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"So I know it's really up to your discretion and what you're comfortable with, but I really, really would like to see at least 1,000 just for your own safety."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Does that make sense?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Yes, ma'am."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"All right, then."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Looking at physical activity, so still don't see any physical activity recorded."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Have you been thinking about, you know, doing any activity in order to hit that goal this week?"
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,You know what?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,I did not get to that last week.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,I'm not even going to pretend like I did.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,So my goal this week is to clock at least two hours.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Do you want to go ahead and set that as your SMART goal?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Yes, please."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,And then most recent wait I see is 2-14.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,Was that this morning?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"Yes, ma'am."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,Then just want to check in.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,Are you still receiving those in-app text messages from us?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"Yes, ma'am."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"All right, then for our next call, if you could go ahead and read lesson six, that one is called Ways to Stay Motivated."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"So by the time we talk on our next call, you will be halfway done with this kind of first portion of the study."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"So I just want to talk about kind of how you've been doing, you know, where you'd like to be for the rest of this study, ways that I can help you, things like that, okay?"
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"And then for our check-in, let's see, next Tuesday is the 29th at 930."
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,That still works.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"Have a good week, Tiffany, okay?"
Margaret/6063.E.w5.8.22.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,You as well.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Alright, so we are in week six, so officially at that halfway point."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded, so today we'll just be going over that lesson, your SMART goal and your data like normal, and then I'll be asking you about the text messages, and then I just want to take some time to also kind of talk about kind of your progress, how you're feeling, areas you want to work on, things like that, okay?"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,So Lesson 6 was called Ways to Stay Motivated.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Were you able to get to that lesson?
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,You know what?
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I forgot about reading the lesson this week.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"So, yeah, really that was just kind of in preparation for what I wanted to talk about a little bit, but we can just kind of talk about kind of how you're feeling in general."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,"So, I mean..."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"You know, we know that, you know, the study is a long commitment."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"You know, one year to be part of anything is a long time."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"And with that, motivation can always, you know, come and go."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"So kind of at this point, how are you feeling about your own motivation?"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"At this point, I'm feeling good because while it's not reflective on the scale, my body is definitely changing."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,And monitoring the food.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,Monitoring the food always helps for me.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"But especially just having, like, the calories and the fat intake, I'm kind of realizing I'm not getting my calories in, but I'm going over my fat."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,So I'm modifying my diet in those ways.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"And I'm starting to see differences in the way my clothes are fitting, which is my ultimate goal."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,That's always happened to me.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,I'm not really a scale person.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"But when I can see, like, the inches coming off and I have a tattoo, when I can see my tattoo again, I'm like, this is working."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"Yeah, that's great."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"You know, there are a lot of ways to measure health, and definitely that number on the scale is not the end-all, be-all for that."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"So I definitely think, you know, it does help to see those other, you know, changes."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Like you said, having more energy, your clothes fitting differently, things like that."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,Those are also huge indicators as well.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Your previous SMART goal.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,So you had said you wanted to do at least 120 minutes of physical activity.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,I did.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,And I only made it to 45.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,We see one day 45 minutes entered.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"So, you know, throughout most of your time in the study so far, it definitely seems like physical activity has been the biggest barrier for you."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"And I know that your job, you know, definitely contributes to that."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"But kind of what I want to talk about, you know, how can we kind of make this more feasible for you?"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"You know, the things that you've been trying to do, you know, unfortunately aren't working."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,So maybe now we can take some time to kind of think of some alternatives.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Um, so have you given kind of any thought to how maybe you could fit that into your daily life?"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,I have not because things are kind of so all over the place right now.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"Hopefully, if everything works out, this will be my last week kind of working both jobs."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,So then I'll just have more down time in order to be able to do stuff.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"Also, um,"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"I thought I was going to have to homeschool my son, but something happened, so now he's out of the house every day and going back to his old school."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,So that changes up things a lot.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"So hopefully once my life calms down, I can get back in the gym as opposed to just having to drive constantly throughout the day."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Yeah, well, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you, you know, that everything works out, you know."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"it's good, you know, not only to have more time for yourself, but also, you know, mental health, things like that."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"So hopefully, you know, things definitely slow down."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"Um, you know, generally what we just suggest, you know, 10 minutes every day, even if you're not hitting, you know, that big, you know, 110 minute goal, 120 minute goal that we set for you."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"If you just start doing like 10 minutes, at least every day, either, you know, like before you go to sleep or before you get in the shower, right when you wake up, something like that."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"Um,"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,those minutes definitely add up but like you said we'll just kind of see where we land in a little bit but hopefully you know you're able to get a little bit of physical activity in during the week let's see the diet portion so last week I saw three days where you ate at least a thousand calories on those days it doesn't quite look like you hit your calorie or fat gram goal so again on those days where you weren't eating at least a thousand was that full recording
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,yeah i saw that that that was not i was recording everything okay i just wanted to um ask you about that but so the days where you did record over a thousand um you were at like 15 30 15 40 so your goal is 1500 so you know that is definitely not over by a large amount so it's not gonna make too much of a difference um it's really like you said earlier the fat grams that maybe
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"And kind of what, you said you've been making a little bit of more changes in your diet."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,So kind of what are those changes that you've been making?
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Just kind of removing the added sugar and really paying attention to the things before I eat them.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"Because before it was just kind of like, okay, well, if I'm in a rush, even if I know it's bad, I'll just do it and deal with it later."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"But now it's kind of just like being conscious and saying, okay, you committed to this."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"make the change, do better."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"Yeah, and then most recent weight, let's see, I see 213, is that correct?"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"Yes, that was this morning, right?"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,So that is a pound down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"We've kind of been yo-yoing a little bit, though, since you started, so this is a good downward trend that we're starting to see, which is good."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"We just kind of want to keep this momentum going so we can keep seeing that number going down, but"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Also, like you said, keeping in mind that weight is not the only measure of health, although it is how we measure your time in the study."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"But I'm sure with the changes that you are talking about that you want to make, we will start seeing that number go down."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"But in general, how are you feeling about your progress so far?"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"Uh, quite honestly, I haven't really had time to think about it with everything that's going on."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"But like I said, you know, when I look in the mirror and I'm like, oh, I see my inches coming off."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,That's very encouraging.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,And then I just wanted to check in.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Have you still been receiving those in-app text messages?
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,It talks a lot about planning within the app.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"Is there, like, a feature..."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,Is in there to kind of meal prep or something that I'm not familiar with?
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"No, I think what it's talking about is just a little bit of what you had just mentioned."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"So, you know, before eating or, you know, even at the beginning of the day, you kind of enter in some food so you have a general idea of where your calories are going to go throughout the day."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,And then you can make adjustments here and there.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,"So we usually tell people it's best to, like, pre-record their foods beforehand."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"Just because people are having a really hard time meeting the goals, sometimes they'll just kind of mindlessly eat and then enter it at the end of the day and then realize that they're over their goal."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"So by doing it early on or in the morning, whenever you'd like, it just gives you a better picture of where you're going to be."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,Gotcha.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,"Then for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 7."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,That would be great.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"And then just take a quick glance at it, you know, even if you don't have time until you know fully read through it, just skimming here and there."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for this week?
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,I really want to try to get to 10 minutes a day.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"Like, I know that is where I've been lacking."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"So I really want to at least, you know, get outside and run in place for 10 minutes or something as simple as that."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,"And then, let's see, next week."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,"Oh, and I've got to remember to wear my Fitbit."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"Yes, that would help."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,"Yeah, it's kind of one of those things, you know, you hop in the shower, so you take it off, and you get to put it back on, or I'm washing dishes, and then, like, six hours later, it's, like, sitting next to the sink."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"Right, right."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"Okay, and then, let's see, next Tuesday, that's going to be the 5th, September 5th at 930."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,That's fine.
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,"All right, then I'll check in with you then."
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6063.E.w6.8.29.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,You too.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are officially in week one of the study."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Then I just wanted to remind you that you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, OK?"
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,"Yes, ma'am."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"So on this call, we'll be going over that lesson that I asked you to read, all of your data."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,We'll talk about your goals a little bit.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,And then we'll go ahead and set your first SMART goal.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,So I asked you to read lesson one.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,That one was called Getting Started with Activity and Healthy Eating.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"Yes, ma'am."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,I didn't really learn anything new.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,It's kind of the basic eat right and exercise feel.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,So I'm already familiar with that.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Yeah, that first one is, you know, review for pretty much everyone."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,So no surprise there.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"Alright, let's go ahead and move on to your data then."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"So just to remind you, your intervention did just start yesterday, so we only have one day of data to look at."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"So yesterday I did see that you recorded at least 1,000 calories, which is great."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"Remember, we really encourage people to eat at least that much."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,We really want to make sure that
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,I know you have enough energy to sustain you throughout the day and that your metabolism isn't crashing.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,So really great job there.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"And you did meet your calorie goal yesterday, which is great."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"Didn't quite hit your fat gram goal, though."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"So I know it's only been one day since the intervention officially started, but do you have kind of any thoughts about meeting your goal so far?"
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,That was just poor planning on my part.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"I started driving for Lyft, and I'm in the car."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,So I literally just like picked something up on my way and it was in the car driving for hours.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Yeah, you know, no problem."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"We know that the first kind of week, even the first couple of weeks, there's a lot of getting used to these goals, especially if you've never tracked calories before."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"And it sounds like, you know, that's going to be one of the big barriers for you is, you know, you're going to be sitting around in a car all day, so you're really going to have to make sure that you kind of, you know, planned your meals very well."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"So kind of thinking about what happened yesterday, do you have kind of an idea in mind of how you kind of want to avoid something like that happening again?"
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Yesterday was just a one-off.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Usually I keep, like, nuts and fruits in the little console of my car."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,for people that get in and for myself as well.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"But I had a meeting for my full-time job, and then I went right to left."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,So it was just kind of a one-off where I didn't get to plan as I normally would.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Great, yeah."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Like I said, no problems there."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"Let's see, physical activity, I don't see anything recorded yet."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"But, you know, that's okay."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Like I said, your intervention just started."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,I signed up for a boot camp class that's an hour long.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,So I wanted to save my whole hour for the boot camp because I've been waiting to boot camp for a while.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,That's awesome.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Yeah, so definitely going to hit those 60 minutes very easily."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"Okay, and then most recent weight I see is 213."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"Yeah, that's from this morning."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"So like I said, not that much to touch on since your intervention just started."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or talk about?
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Nope, I think I'm doing pretty good."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Oh, there's no way in the app to track water intake."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,Is there?
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,I thought I saw it and then I didn't see it when I went to put it in.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"No, unfortunately, we don't track water because we're only really tracking calories."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,Sorry.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"Okay, no problem."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,I just wanted to make sure.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"All right, then for that next call, go ahead and read the next lesson."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,That one is number two.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,It's...
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,called Healthy Eating.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"So this one is, you know, kind of another kind of review if you're already familiar with these topics, but you know, you can just kind of gloss it over."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,And then we can go ahead and set your first SMART goal.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"So just to remind you what these are, remember you'll be setting this goal every week."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"It's something that you feel like you can work on from one week to the next week that'll kind of help you, help push you along with this kind of weight, excuse me, weight loss journey, behavior change, things like that."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"So do you kind of have something in mind, something that you feel like you could work on in the next week?"
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"You know, I would like to cook more food."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,I've been eating out a lot.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,So I would like to cook more.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"So with that, do you want to say, is it that, you know, you want to cook more and then so you want to have more meals prepared throughout the week?"
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Is that it?
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,So it's like a meal plan.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,Boom.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,It's so smart.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"And then for our call next week, does this day and time generally work or would you like to move it around?"
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"Oh, this day and time generally works."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,"So that will be next Tuesday, August 1st at 930."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,Talk to you then.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,All right.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6063.F.w1.7.25.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,We are in week two of the study.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,And I had asked you to read lesson two.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,That one was healthy eating for this call.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Yes, ma'am."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,And what did you think of that?
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,A lot of that information.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"I can't say that it was information that I didn't know because I kind of, I like know what I need to do."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,It's just about trying to sometimes.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"A lot of information that I was familiar with and knew already, just from health journeys in the past."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Yeah, good to hear you know that you're already aware of these practices."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"It's always good to have a little bit of a review on them, and like you said, it's really about putting it into practice."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"Let's see then, your SMART goal, you had said you wanted to meal prep."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,So how did that go this past week?
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,It went terribly.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,I've been working like around the clock.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"So I put up nuts and fruits sometimes, but I did end up eating fast food more than I would like to."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"So are you saying that really, you know, time restriction is kind of your biggest barrier right now?"
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Correct, yes."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"Are you generally, you know, this busy, or does it kind of vary?"
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,This is completely outlandish to me.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,I am never like I have been running these past couple of weeks.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"All right, well, I'm sorry to hear that."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Hopefully, you know, this week kind of slows down a little bit."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Let's go ahead then and go over your data.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"So this past week, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories, six out of the seven days."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,It looks like you met your calorie goal three of those days.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"On those days where we were over your calorie and fat gram, what were those kind of most busy days?"
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,Absolutely.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"Like, I was literally working from 9 a.m."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,to 10 at night those days.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,And I was just ripping and running.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Yeah, so do you think, you know, on those days, kind of what contributed to those high calories?"
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Was it the foods that you were choosing, or was it the quantity?"
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,It was the food that I was choosing.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,It was all that.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Yeah, so, you know, once in a while these busy days may occur again."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,Do you feel like there's something that you could have done differently that would have kind of helped you stay within your goals or maybe even lower the amount of calories that
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"I even think if I had just chosen to boo more wisely, like if I had gotten a side salad as opposed to a mushroom steak burger with bacon, it would have helped a lot."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"Yeah, and, you know, like you said, obviously you're very aware of healthy eating and kind"
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"And there's really not much involved there besides your own kind of choice, you know, smart choices that you're making and, you know, will behind your actions."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"So just some things, you know, that maybe you can keep in mind when you are in those really busy situations and it is going to be tempting to, like you said, grab that quick burger."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"You know, just kind of reminding yourself, you know, you are in this study."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"You did commit to meeting these goals for your own health, of course."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"Also, you know, remind yourself of your motivation, why you want to lose weight, why it's important to you, things like that."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Of course, you know, once in a while going over isn't going to be too bad, but we like to set up, you know, a pattern of just kind of making those smarter food choices so down the line it becomes easier."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Does that make sense?
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,That makes a lot of sense.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,Looking at physical activities.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Yeah, so... From last week till I went to bed, like, that was all I was going."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,And I think he's catching up with me this week.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,Because I was completely exhausted yesterday.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,I know that last time you had mentioned you joined a boot camp.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,63,unknown,Do you feel like this week you're going to be able to attend that?
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"Yeah, it's at the gym up the street from my house."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"Alright, and then most recent weight I see is 209."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Is that correct?
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"I don't put my contacts in before I weigh myself, so I can't see the number."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,But that's what it is.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"Okay, alright."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"So, actually that is..."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,So we'll just kind of see where we land next week.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,So kind of what were you thinking of doing this week that could help you stick to your goals?
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"Literally on Sunday, I picked up"
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,everything that I had.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,So as opposed to me having to make something from scratch or I literally just have to reach in the fridge and get it heated up or not even heated up and it's ready to go.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"Oh, that's great."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,So at least you were able to feel
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"And so now in terms of dinner, everything's there."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,I can just pick them out.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,"For our next call, if you could go ahead, read Lesson 3."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,That one was called Adding Activity to Your Day.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"So maybe this one will give you some ideas on just how to get, you know, a small balance of physical activity."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"I don't know if this is crazy, but I would like to come down two pounds."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,"So, um, you know, in order to do that, do you feel like, um, just, you know, sticking to the meals that you had prepped, um, and getting in, you know, going to that boot camp, do you feel like sticking to those will help you lose those, that two pounds?"
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,I believe it will.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"Now, am I restricted to the 80 minutes?"
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,I can only do the 80?
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,"No, you can definitely go over that."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,That's fine.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,That's just your minimum.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,Gotcha.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,"And then for our check-in next week, so if we do same day and time, it's going to be next Tuesday at 930."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,That is perfect.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"All right, Tiffany."
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6063.F.w2.8.1.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,Thank you so much.

Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,Good.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,1,patient,"I was reading through it, and it has a lot of points that I certainly recognize in the way I've been handling stuff like this."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,"You know, what you're eating."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"when you're eating, why you're eating, and some tips and tricks, like things to just think about, like drink more water during a meal, eat slower, and how all these things contribute to how you eat and weight loss."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"And then, let's see, your previous SMART goal, so you kind of wanted to look into other"
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,Good.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"I've done the elliptical before, and I kind of like that in tandem with doing some jogging."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"I also did the row machine, which I actually liked very much because the sound and the movement was very slow, rapid, but it felt like a good full-body cardio thing without..."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"you know, doing push-ups and stuff like that, which I do, but I'm not happy about."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,So just trying to find some other stuff around there.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,I tried the step machine.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,I hate stairs.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,Won't be going back there.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,That's just me.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"But yeah, just trying to mix it up along with doing some... I try to do some weight training stuff for my arms."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"So trying to just build some muscle there, but..."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,I think it was good.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,I liked the elliptical.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,That was good.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,The row machine was good.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,And no StairMaster for me.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"Okay, so looking at your data, another really amazing week."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"So since we last talked, it's been eight days."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"So you did report at least 1,000 calories all eight of those days."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,Your calorie factor and goal all eight of those days.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"For last week, I did see physical activity in the last seven days."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,28,unknown,You did 500.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Yep, so another two pounds down, so still going strong."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"You know, not much to really comment on since we ate so well."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"For those meal replacements, still using two a day?"
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,33,unknown,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,And then still receiving those in-app text messages?
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,36,unknown,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Then our next lesson is going to be number 11.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,That one is balance your thoughts.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"And then for this week, what would you like your SMART goals to be?"
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"Well, even though I did – it registers, like, exercise on the weekend."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"It's usually walking around here and there, like, just doing – because last week was a particularly busy week, so I don't – I know it won't be as high this week because I've been, unfortunately, a little too busy to get as much –"
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"exercise, gym time, as I would like."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"But on the weekends, like, I carry it with me, the tracker with me, if I'm going to, like, the grocery store or something like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"But I would like to try and get more, like, maybe not, like, gym-level stuff, but more, like, exercise, like, more, like, walking, walking."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"There was, a few weeks ago, I was kind of stuck in the house for a little bit, and I think on, like, a Saturday night, I was just so..."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"kind of cabin fever that I got out and did, like, a four-mile walk."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"So I think I want to try and, like, add more exercise in the weekend that isn't just walking to and from, like, Trader Joe's or something."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"And then, let's see, next Thursday, that's going to be the 28th at our usual time, 9 o'clock."
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,Wonderful.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,You too.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6067.D.w10.9.22.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Yes, looks like there was a lot of info on like responding to"
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"negative thinking, examples of, like, self-defeating thoughts, how that's important, why it's important, what it does, and a lot of things you can do or some things to do to try and get yourself out of that mindset so you can avoid."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"It felt like, you know, things you can do to avoid, you know, a tailspin from, like, turning into, like, from it turning into a slide instead of just a flip."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"So you want to kind of do more exercise on the weekend, but isn't just walking, you know, do some more natural physical activity?"
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Good.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,"Well, with the heat, it was kind of difficult to do some stuff, so we just did kind of walking."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"But my husband and I made sure, you know, once the sun went down, like on Friday and Saturday, we made sure once the sun went down, we went out for like a walk for like an hour or so."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,just to try and get some of that going.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"And now that it's cooled off a little bit, we might even be able to do it during the day, so that'd be nice."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"Looking at your data, so I heard over the weekend there was a big problem with that too."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Yeah, and it's actually still pretty glitchy."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,The problem I was having over the weekend was that the –
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,So I have a large selection in the custom area because I do cook a lot.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"And so I would enter it in, and it would not calculate any of the calories or the fat."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"So I'd enter it in, and it was registering all zeros."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,So I would...
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"If I would, like, look stuff up, like if I was... Sometimes I'll go to, like, Starbucks and get, like, a cafe misto."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"If I look stuff up that way, calories and stuff would pop up."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,So I kind of try to deal with it that way.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"However, I've also now noticed that, like, if I'm entering in..."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"like the meal replacement stuff, the same thing is happening."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"So I drink the meal replacement with almond milk, and I put that in as my custom, and I'll put it in, and it'll come up as zero calories and zero fat, and then I'll enter in the meal replacements of scoops, and it'll register the fat but not the calories."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"So Saturday, Sunday, and, like, Thursday,"
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"including this morning, for the rest of the week, the data's completely off."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,I've tried to track it on paper as I go along.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"So my numbers for this week are going to look like I'm basically eating, you know, an orange and a donut and that's it."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"When I've actually, like..."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,It's going to be off.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,The data's going to be off.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,I'm entering it in.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"I'm entering what it is, and I'm entering portion sizes now, so at least that's there, and my diet really hasn't varied too much, so my hope is that maybe down the road..."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"I don't know, down the road it will correct itself or something."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"But like I said, this morning when I put in my meal replacement, the only thing that popped up was the two fat grams for the powder, for the soup."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,So my dad is going to be off this week.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"But I'm still, like I said, I'm trying to write it down and I'm trying to do the math before I eat anyway."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,So...
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"In my head, I should still be within the parameters, but it's not going to reflect in the data."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,It's going to look like I'm not eating.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,40,unknown,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"Yeah, so kind of, you know, as inconvenient as it is, maybe a good experience."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"Well, yeah, exactly."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,Correct.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Yeah, this week, because I've switched up the exercise, and I just was not able to do as much exercise last week."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,And what I did was kind of low impact.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"And I do, you know, and I kind of figured, like, okay, that's not going to happen."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"So I think for my goal for next week is to go back to the more high impact stuff to kind of,"
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"Okay, I've done the low impact."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"I know what I like, what I don't like."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Okay, let's get back to the high impact."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,We can get back on track.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Yeah, I want to go back to the high impact for next week just because I like the low impact and it's good to get more variety in there."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"But especially since it was kind of a lower, slower week, which happened, which is fine."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"I don't want to use that as an excuse like, okay, well, I can do the low-impact stuff and I can at least maintain."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"That's not, you know, the goal of it."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"I mean, the goal is to maintain, but the goal is to actually do the work."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,59,unknown,Then let's see.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,60,unknown,Are you still using two new replacements?
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,And then are you still receiving those in-app text messages?
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"Yes, I am."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,So that part of it is still working.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Of course.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,So our next lesson is going to be on what we just pledged to help.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"We're just going to go down, let's see, for our call next week."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"Next Thursday is going to be the 5th, and that's going to be at 9."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,Is that okay?
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"And then just to let you know, since next week will be our last call, it will be a little bit longer just because we have a lot of things that I have talked a little bit about yesterday."
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,It's a couple of relations.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,76,unknown,Thank you.
Margaret/6067.D.w11.9.28.17.MD.MP3,77,unknown,You too.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so week 12, this is our last call."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Let's see, lesson 12, weight loss plateau."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Yes, dealing with plateaus, how they happen, why they happen, the frequency, all that kind of stuff, yeah."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yeah, do you feel like you've encountered a plateau yet?"
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Quite a few, yes."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I think that's kind of been...
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Yeah, I would, you know, lose weight."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"You know, I'd lose, you know, two or three pounds, and then I'd plateau for a few days."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"And then I'd lose a little bit of weight, and then I'd plateau."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,So that has actually become quite familiar to me.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"So it's, you know, not something I enjoy, but it's something, oh, yep, this happens."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,Happens all the time.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"So, yeah, you know, this lesson really just gave some general tips."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"You know, the reason why we usually have people read it at the end is just because"
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,at least you're on your own.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"So in case that ever comes up, you know, you kind of have a way to deal with it."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"But, yeah, you know, everybody's different."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"And it seems like, you know, even though you said you've encountered your own plateau, it hasn't been too difficult getting over that."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Going through the lesson, you know, I talked about reasons why they occur and steps to get past it or to deal with it."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"And they all seem very familiar to me, you know."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"You know, we've discussed that, you know, need to, okay, need to change the food, need to change the routine, need to change what type of exercises you're doing when you're doing it because, you know, your body will get used to what you're doing, which is how plateaus happen."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"So you've got to, you know, as they say, mix it up."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Okay, now let's see your previous SMART goal."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,So you said you wanted to do more high-impact physical activity.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,30,unknown,How did that go this past week?
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Good.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"I went back to my, I have like a selection of stuff that I do instead of just doing like the elliptical and the row machine."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"I went back to just, you know, straight arms and, excuse me, weight training and cardio along with jogging."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"So that's, again, that's, you know, noticing that there's a little bit of a plateau, so I have to go."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,back and step up the intensity of the workout.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,36,unknown,"Okay, and then just so we know briefly, you've got another great week."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,37,unknown,"So six days where you recorded the 6,000 calories."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,38,unknown,"You met your goal, in fact, your goal all six of those days."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Across seven days, you did 463 minutes."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,So you did meet that 300-minute goal.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"And then most recently, I see you as the correct."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"Yeah, so that is..."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"So on this call, like I said last time, I just kind of want to talk about moving forward, you know, after your three months."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,46,unknown,So do you kind of remember what's going to happen during and after that three-month assessment?
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"I do understand that, you know, the calls are going to be no longer completed."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,I think I have my appointment on the 10th.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"You know, returning the Fitbit and the scale, that's the measurements."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"They're going to retake, you know, re-weigh and re-measure and do all that to get a point-by-point measurement."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,analysis of where I started and where I ended.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,52,unknown,"So I'm kind of just curious, you know, how you're thinking of moving forward."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"You know, like you said, especially for you, you were receiving all of the components."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,54,unknown,It's definitely going to be a big change.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,So did you kind of have any thoughts to how you're going to keep moving forward?
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Yes, I actually do."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,I like the meal replacement stuff.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,I'm going to keep that going for at least one meal a day.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"The convenience of it, the ease of it is good."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,I'm going to try to stick to the same calorie and fat intake goal.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Am I still using the app or will that also be...
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,And available.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,It's up to you.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"You'll have access to it, but if you want to switch to something else, then you can't."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,I will definitely be still using an app.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"You know, the data proves that it works."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"You know, it just proves that it works."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"No, I pretty much am going to stick to the same things that I've been doing because, you know, I remember when I went in 12 weeks ago and I weighed about, that first initial weight was about 169 pounds."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,Now I'm down to about 149 pounds.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,So it works.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,It all works.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,I will be... I pretty much am going to keep myself on that plateau.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,I still have some more weight that I would like to lose.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"Since I know this works, I'm going to stick with it."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"You know, because..."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,It's what's working.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"Yeah, I was going to say, you know, a 20-pound loss in 12 weeks is definitely great."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"Especially, you know, the meal replacement condition makes us a little bit nervous."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,We never know how people are going to react to that.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"But you really took everything in stride, which is really awesome."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"And you've done amazingly well, you know, since you started."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"20 pounds is a lot to lose in 12 weeks, so really you should congratulate yourself."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,Well from everything that I've I've read and you know I do try to not just stick with that stuff I do actually try to actually do research about this and for someone my height I should be
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"I think I did the body mass index check I think on Monday or Tuesday, and I think I'm just below the parameters for being overweight."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,So I'm like on the higher end of being the proper body mass index for my height.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,I'd like to get that down a bit.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"So I think for someone my height, I think they said the ratio was somewhere between like..."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"120 and 140 pounds, so definitely want to shoot for the 140 ideally, especially given that there are some medical... I mean, everyone has a medical history, but for my medical history, would probably want to get that closer to the 130 mark simply because, you know, I see that the change makes a difference."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"You know, when I started the program, I had acid reflux, and I was taking antacid tablets, you know, like twice a day."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"And if I didn't take them, I was feeling, you know, very acidy and very upset."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"In the last, like, month or two, I think I've maybe taken three pills."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,Wow.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,"So, you know, and I'm not saying that, you know, it's the end-all, be-all, but,"
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"You know, because I do as much reading and as research and, you know, it's so much of what happens to us is because of the food we eat."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,It just is.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,There's so many things that are attributed to poor diet and weight gain.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"I think there's an article I was reading, I can't remember in the Times or maybe Esquire, how there's, you know, new studies are starting to come out about all the cancers associated with"
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,weight gain and obesity and all these things are like I this is like the one thing I can fix the one thing I can do um so ideally I would like to get another lose another 20 pounds because that is the sweet spot for where I medically should be anyway um
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,I'd like at least 140.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,"130, you know, I know that would probably... That's going to be the tough... That last 10 pounds are going to be the tough one because it's always the tough one."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,"You know, just like the thing was talking about the plateau."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,"You plateau, your body gets used to the... It's not going to like... I don't like exercising."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,I do it because it works.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,But it's not... I like... I mean...
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,"I just remember when I started exercising and looking at the mirror and, you know, even my exercise clothes are starting to, you know, kind of fall down because they don't fit, which is great."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,I like that.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,I'm okay with my clothes not fitting because it's the opposite direction.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,"So, you know, ultimately would like, you know, that change is..."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,"I know some people have trouble with the change, and I certainly, you know, have my days where it's like, gee, I would really love a hot dog and french fries and a milkshake."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,"Eh, maybe not all that."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"But it's just a choice of where do you want to be, where do you want your future to be, and, you know, it works, so I want to stick with it."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"All right, then, just to check in on your complaints one last time, so..."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,And are you still receiving the in-app text messages?
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,"Then, of course, there are no more lessons for us to read."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,"I just wanted to let you know, if you ever feel the need to read any of those ever again, we'll have access to those so you can always go back to those."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,"Did you want to set one last SMART goal for yourself, maybe for now until that three months last minute?"
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,"I think kind of going back to the food stuff, I have been, you know, very slowly but surely testing new foods out and trying to do stuff like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,"So, you know, again, I always – because that seems to be, you know, it's exercise or food."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,"And that's, again, the theme of all this."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,128,patient,"I have been starting to look at more – not necessarily vegetarian options, but leaning more towards that –"
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,direction.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,"Again, going back and reading the lesson for this week, one of the problems people have with plateaus is that your body just literally does not have enough fuel."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,"Calories are calories, but if it's the wrong calories, it doesn't matter."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,132,patient,"You know, a nice piece of, you know, turkey breast is certainly better than, you know, a can of Coke."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,"So I want to try and get, again, a"
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,"Going back to trying to find a more variety of stuff and not necessarily going vegetarian, but trying to find flavor options in there instead of going back to dairy or fried foods or sweet or sugary stuff or salty stuff."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,135,advisor,"Well, I just wanted to say, you know, again, congratulations for all the progress that you've made."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,136,advisor,"You've done so well throughout the study, always meeting the goals, making my job a lot easier."
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,137,advisor,"So, really, I just wanted to wish you all the best of luck in the future, okay?"
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,Wonderful.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,139,patient,Thank you so much.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,140,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,141,advisor,"Then we will see you, let's see, next Tuesday at 8.30, okay?"
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,142,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,Have a good week.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,145,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,146,patient,You too.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,147,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,148,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6067.D.w12.10.05.17.MD.MP3,149,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Alright, we are in week three of the study."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Today's probably going to be a little bit of a longer call since you were re-randomized into the study, so quite a few things to go over today, but as always, we'll start off by going over that lesson."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Lesson three, that was adding activity to your day."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yes, I printed it off a few days ago."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I saw that there's a lot of
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"notes that they want, there's a lot of questions, the graph for you, how many hours you're sitting, trying to calculate that, and just going over all of the material."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"Yeah, it seems like, you know, so far you're not having any problem getting in physical activity, so probably not too much to learn there, but, you know, always a good reminder."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Well, going over, looking over the stretching stuff, I actually, when I went to the gym yesterday, overstretched one of the muscles."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"So it actually, like, okay, here's the stuff I need to skip."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"Here's good stuff, you know."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,And the muscle I actually ended up pulling was one I had not stretched out.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,So it was my own fault.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"But, you know, good to go back to refresh, like, yep, you need to do all these things for five or ten minutes."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"before and after because it does make a difference, as I know from experience."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"So are you able to still do physical activity, or are you just resting right now?"
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"It was a muscle in my leg, so I was able to do some walking and some jogging without any pain, so that was fine."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,And I also did just some upper body weight training instead.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"Alright, and then your previous SMART goal, so you had said you wanted to meet your FAT-GRAM goal three of those days, so let's go ahead and begin with the first one."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Do you feel like you were doing well with your FAT-GRAM goal this past week?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,I think I did well.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"Actually, the meal replacement stuff does actually help."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"One of the things that I did, at least Monday through Friday, when I get home, I usually cook dinner."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,And so it actually does work out because I don't really have to worry about breakfast too much or lunch.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,And healthier snacks are easier to eat.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"I think are easier to do than trying to, you know, do a huge salad or whatever else for that."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"And then in the evening, I can do actually a little more substantial dinner, which is good for the both of us because my husband's a bit bigger than I am, so he needs a few more calories than I do."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Okay, let's go ahead and go over your data then."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"So, let's see."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories this past week."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"One of the days, it looks like you did more calories than Google that one day, so that's something that I did want to drop on this call."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,And I kind of just wanted to hear from you.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"let's see, even, it looks like even before you had started being meal replacements, it looks like you weren't quite hitting 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Can you tell me about that?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"Part of, again, I'm going back to trying to find foods that are"
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,Higher in calorie that don't have fat.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"Unfortunately, a lot of my diet used to have things like dairy and pasta and starches, which have the calories but also have the fat."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,So trying to figure out how to...
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"get rid of the fat, and add the calories back in."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"So trying to find more fresher fruits, like I noticed that oranges have more calories than, like, my average whatever snack."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,So trying to find stuff like healthier replacements like that.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"I think I tend more towards cutting the fat than the calories, and unfortunately that does –"
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"make me under in calories, but again, still just trying to learn how to get the fat and the calories at a more even level, and that just requires more education on my part."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"I would really strongly suggest, even if you go over the fat, Graham goes a little bit, to really try to hit that at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"I can't stress enough, especially at the level that you're at, how important it is."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"And, you know, I do understand it takes a lot of playing around with this since you're only at the 1,200-calorie goal, but, you know, things like brown rice, like the healthier types of bread, you know, a cup of brown rice might have, like, 200 calories, but it's only two grams of fat."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Yeah, I actually do have some whole wheat English muffins that I just got that I want to start."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,adding that as a snack because that doesn't have a lot of fat in it either.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"But the brown rice, I do have brown rice, and I didn't even think about that, so that's something I'll add to that."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Yeah, awesome."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"And then, let's see."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"So I do want to, or maybe we'll go over your physical activity first."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,So last week your goal was to do 300 minutes.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"I saw 400 minutes entered, so really great job there."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"It looks like you are entering in physical activity most of the days, six out of the seven days, so doing very well there."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 164.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,So that is two pounds down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,So right around that steady point.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,Go ahead and talk about the meal replacements.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,I'm sure you'll have a lot to say about those.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,How's it been going for you so far?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"The first time I tried it, I tried it with water and it took me about an hour and a half to drink that and then I actually do get unsweetened vanilla almond milk from Trader Joe's and I've been actually drinking that periodically for about a year now and so I actually mix that with the almond milk and it tastes a lot better and again, it's"
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"It's actually, as busy as I am, it's actually very helpful for a convenience factor."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"Like, okay, there's breakfast, there's lunch."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"Because it's summer, I can at least try to get some more fresh fruits in there, watermelon, oranges."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"probably more apples and stuff, just trying to get more stuff like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"So actually from a convenience stand, it's been really helpful, and that has made it easier for me to go, yes, you're going to do this because it actually saves a whole lot more time."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Yeah, I'm glad."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"You know, you have such a positive mindset about it, so that's really good."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,Have you been using two every day since Monday?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"Yep, every day."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Well, I think Monday I had breakfast and I had dinner."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,So Monday I think I just had it for lunch.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"But for the rest of the, so far, for the rest of the week, yes."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"And then, so one thing that we were kind of aware of when we were looking at the meal replacements is we do realize that the one that we chose is a little bit low on calories."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,So kind of how have you been supplementing that?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,Have you been having free meals?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"Like I said, I'm trying to up it with some more fruit, trying to actually have a more substantial but still healthier dinner."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"Actually, on Monday I made salmon dinner for the two of us that actually my husband really liked, so I can start looking at maybe having something."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"He's not really a secret person, but he'll basically eat whatever I make in front of him."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"So if it's something like a healthier, like chicken thighs or a lean pork chop or a piece of fish that is, you know, that way I can have the fat in the right place and get the calories in the right place, trying to explore options like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,And then?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,90,unknown,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"Either, like, any questions you have about your re-organization or anything like that?"
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,No.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"The only thing that does, I do notice that does kind of discourage me, that sometimes I'll lose a little weight and then I'll put it back."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,"But then I have to remember, like, because I do..."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"decent amount of weight training and that I maybe need to, like, cut back on that and do a little bit more cardio to kind of balance it out."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"But at the same time, you know, it's not a bad thing to have more muscle on the body in the long run because trying to do stuff like push-ups and even though crunches don't really use the arms but still kind of more upper body strength in the long run is going to be a better..."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"It's going to be better for me for the long run, but it does get a little discouraging."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"Like, oh, look, I lost a pound and a half."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,"Oh, look, I gained it back."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,"But wait, I spent a half an hour lifting weights on my arm, and my arms actually really seem to take to it very well."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,So I just need to make sure that I know that that's not...
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"discouraging, yes, I'm putting on weight, but I'm not putting on fat."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"And, you know, one thing that we like to tell people, we know that for the scope of this study, we are paying attention to weight, but of course that number is not the indicator of your health."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,"There's so much that goes into, you know, being a healthy person, having a healthy body."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"So, you know, like you said, don't be too discouraged by that number."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,"Also, that is one of the reasons why I want to make sure that you are eating at 1,000 calories, so we want to kind of up and down yo-yo"
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,"Because, you know, as soon as you start to deal with it, it's going to get you back on the last minute, so you just want to take consistency."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,"Exactly, exactly."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,"So I need to figure out, I just need to still figure out how to get there, so."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,Excuse me.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,"All right, then for our next call, if you'd just go ahead and read lesson four."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,117,unknown,Uh-huh.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,118,unknown,And then what would your most smart ways be for the week?
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"I know I do need to hit that minimum of 1,000 calories every week, so I would like to try and, like you said, focus a little bit less on the fat grams and a little bit more on actually hitting the 1,000 a day."
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,121,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,"And for our call next week, so that is going to be next Thursday the 10th at 9 a.m., is that okay?"
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,Wonderful.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,128,patient,Thank you so much.
Margaret/6067.D.w3.8.3.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,Oh.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"So lesson four, making smart food choices."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,"Yes, I was looking at that."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,A lot of it looked like he was talking about eating out and then trying to come up with healthier snack options and stuff like that.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"take a lot of guesswork out of food choices, but you know, there is, um, you do still need to consume, you know, snacks and there is that other meal."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Have you found that you've been having trouble making smarter food choices or kind of what has your experience been so far?
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Um, usually pretty good."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"Actually, my husband and I went out to eat on, uh,"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,Tuesday.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Um, I went a little bit over, but I, I did try to make sure, okay, I don't, I don't need to have any, any drinks."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,I'll just have iced tea.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"We'll have just, you know, a couple of slices of pizza and trying to, um, you know, I don't need a meat lovers pizza."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"Let's do, I think I got the, uh, cheese and arugula."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"So at least it's not, you know,"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"At least I thought that was not as bad as, say, he got the meat lovers."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"So just trying to think of, like it says, better, lower-fat, healthier options."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"And then your previous SMART goal, so you said you really wanted to focus on eating at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"I do see all seven days, it looks like you did, so really great job there."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,Good to see you at least eating that number.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,And your data looked really great this past week.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Out of those seven days where you recorded at least 1,000 calories, you met your calorie goal six of those days, and your fat"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"You know, in general, you're at right about, like, 1,100, so that's a pretty good place to be."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"And, you know, there are two days where you didn't meet the fat grim goal, but, again, not too bad."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,You weren't over it by that much.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Yeah, except for that one Tuesday of trying to, you know, and that was actually, I think, one of the first times we had gone, because there's a couple of places that we go out to eat, and I can kind of maneuver around that."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"a number of those, but, you know, I couldn't resist the pizza, so that one was a little tricky, but that's okay."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Yeah, it's definitely okay, and, you know, you didn't go over the calories, which is, you know, more important for weight loss, but also, you know, this is, these changes that you're making, you know, that healthy eating is supposed to be sustainable, it's just not realistic if you're, you know,"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,not eating the foods that you want to once in a while.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"So as long as, you know, the next day you're back on track, which you definitely did, you know, have that pizza, have whatever you want."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"Yeah, no, it's just, it's, I remember I was talking to my dad about it last week, and he says, well, what's all the things you can't eat?"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"And I said, it's not about can't eat, it's about, if I want, I can have, you know, this, that, or the other thing, I just can't eat the whole thing, or, you know, it's just,"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"like the program says, making the better choices."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"One I always hear is that everyone denies themselves everything left, right, and center, and then the program doesn't work."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,That's not how this is going to work.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"I have to have French fries every once in a while, but I don't need them more than once a week."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Right, exactly, exactly."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Okay, and then physical activity, really great."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"Across six days, you did 523 minutes, so completely blew that 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 163.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,Does that sound correct?
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Yep, so that is another pound down from the last time we checked in, so doing really well, right on track."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,How is this upcoming week looking?
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Any social engagements, anything like that?"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"No, nothing big coming up."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"Like I said, I try to get to the gym after work."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"The advantage of not having a car is that you have to walk everywhere, so that's really helped with it."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"I was a little frustrated because I kept fluctuating for a while between 166 and 164, and even though it's only been 163 for the last..."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,few days it hasn't gone up so I know that that's actually it has been working I didn't do as much as I wanted to yesterday but I was just a little funky and tired so I know that sometimes you know exercise in general is good but you don't want to push and hurt your body so if it's you know just spending extra time just on the treadmill that's still better than nothing
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Then have you been using the meal replacements consistently to a day?
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,And how are those going for you?
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,They're fine.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"You know, again, the convenience of it is actually very appealing to me."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"I get unsweetened vanilla almond milk from Trader Joe's and mix it with that, and that"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,twice a day and that seems to be working quite well so no problem there and it's when you at least for me if I'm starting to think lighter anyway like okay I need to get some snacks in between and I need to find stuff that has lower fat but still some calories trying to I think that's what I would like for my next goal is to try to find a better variety for snacks in between because right now it's kind of like
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,I'll have an orange and I'll have some veggie sticks.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"And then, you know, sometimes when I get down to dinner, it's kind of like, okay, well, I've been so good during the day that I'll save it for dinner."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"And then when I get to dinner time, I don't want all that stuff and all that food."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"So trying to find a better variety or, you know, maybe more fruits and vegetables or just general sneaky snacks during the day would be, I think, the next thing to look towards for the week."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"All right, and then are you still receiving those text messages, the in-app notifications?"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"I've actually, and I've emailed the program about this, the app on Monday, it looked like it kind of reset itself."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"The section where you implement food, the meal replacement option is gone."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"Like, it just says, I think it just says frequent, recent, and custom."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"Now, because I've"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"do consistently do the mail replacement, I can just pull that option back up in recent, but the mail replacement section has disappeared, and I don't get the emails anymore, which, I mean, I don't want to say I don't need them because it's still only the first month, but at the same time, it's like, well, okay."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"So, yeah, that was one thing that..."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"And I think I emailed on Monday and someone responded like, oh, we'll have tech look into that."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"But it's still not up, so."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,I will go ahead and look into that.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"Yeah, the text messages, you know, are part of your interventions, so we definitely want you to be receiving those, so I'll go ahead and look into that."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,"And then for our next call, just go ahead and, let's see, we are on Lesson 5."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,"So this one is about navigating, like, social cues, any gatherings and holidays."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,We know that those can be especially tricky.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"Ah, yes."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"And then you set your SMART goals, so you said you wanted to find, you know, more snacks for you to have between meals, so just introducing that variety."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,"And then for our call next week, I am actually not going to be here next Thursday and Friday."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"So is there a time, either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, that you can talk?"
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,Any of those days is fine by me.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,We can do Wednesday.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,Would 9-15 be okay?
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,"You guys have a great week, Karen."
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6067.D.w4.8.10.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,You too.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,So we are in week five.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you can reach me on YouTube for these calls."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Lesson five, navigating social cues, gatherings, and health."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"Yes, I saw a lot of the, it looked like a lot of the stuff was covering things on basically alternatives, how to deal with social situations and how to deal with, like, peer pressure from other people asking you to eat all that delicious but unhealthy food."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,4,unknown,Do you find?
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Well, I don't, since we don't have too many family stuff going on in the summer right now, or at least I don't, I haven't had too many times to go up against that."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Although, having reviewed, knowing that a couple times I've gone out beforehand, and then over the weekend I actually went to go visit my parents, and we grabbed lunch, and it was..."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"one of those times where, okay, I need to, you know, my father's not pressuring me, but it's not like, you know, we're going for a salad."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"We went for, you know, just like burgers and hot dogs and stuff and trying to find something that I can work, you know, can I do a smaller size?"
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,Do I need to do like a half portion and then save the half for later?
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,So I did find myself actually trying to
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"strategically decide what should I eat, what should I not eat, what could I eat, what could I do without."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"So I haven't had too many challenges, but I like that a lot of the activities kind of included giving you, helping you plan out how to answer the question of, oh, why don't you try this?"
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"Or, you know, hey, we've got this, don't you want a bite?"
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"It doesn't seem like a thing, but it does happen."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,It happens all the time.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"And then your previous SMARCLE, so you said you wanted to look into some other snack options that you could have between your meals."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"Yeah, pretty good."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"I found a couple of, like, Cheeky Snacks or Trader Joe's."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,I'm trying to find something that has calories but no fat and not a lot of fat.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,other stuff in there and they have a lot of snack options so it kind of took me a while to go through them but I found like two or three there and actually when I was at I went to Costco over the weekend and they have this little like chicken and cilantro little wonton bites that I used to get all the time and then I just stopped eating them and I went back and thought oh let me take a look and you know the portion you get four little wontons are only like 50 calories and one gram of fat I was like oh my gosh I can use this
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Especially, like, at night or at dinner."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"If I'm not, because if I'm busy at work, I can't always even out the calories like I would like to."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"So I do have to sometimes, excuse me, make it up on the back end."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"But, you know, so I can have, like, eight little guys for only 100 calories."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"It's like, oh, my gosh."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"I can supplement all this stuff, so that's actually."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"And actually doing, when I make dinner, make brown rice and then make more of it and then throw a little, you know, chicken and vegetable in there."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,That actually has helped.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"Oh, I can make more here, plan for tomorrow."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,So that actually has helped a bit.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"All right, and just to go over your day."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,Another good week.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"I see that you've gained at least 1,000 calories all six days."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"So since the last time we talked, it's only been six days, not a full week."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"It looks like you've met your calorie goal all six of those days, and then your fat great goal four of those days."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,This got to be really cool.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Most recently, I see it once a day."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Is that right?
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So, yeah, it looks like we're kind of hanging in around there."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"But, you know, that's okay."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,Maintaining is always better than maintaining.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Yeah, yeah."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Also, I might have mentioned this before."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,I might have not.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"But you are on the lower end of the calorie and fat-gram goal spectrum, which means you have less weight to lose than everybody else."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,But that also means it's going to be a little bit more difficult for you to maintain.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"So, you know, as long as you're being very diligent."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Yes, I have."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"I don't know if I got one today, though."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,I don't know if they sent one out this morning.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"I don't think I got one today, but I got one yesterday and the day before."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"Then for our next call, I'm going to ask you to read Lesson 6."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,So that one is called Ways to Stay Motivated.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"By the next time we talk, you will be halfway through this initial part of the study."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,So we're just going to be asking you to...
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"progress, see how you're feeling about your motivation, things like that, and then we'll talk about that a little bit on that call."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"Well, I was actually talking to my husband about this a little bit yesterday and this morning, how I've kind of been hovering around 163, which, again, maintaining is better than gaining."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,And since I've been focusing on trying to get my calories and my fat grams leveled off.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"And one thing I actually noticed on Monday when I went to the gym, I feel like I do actually now need to really step up."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"the exercise, maybe not the amount of it, but the intensity."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"Uh, since I've been doing it for about a month, you know, anything that all my muscles are pretty much under the impression that this is what we're doing right now, whether or not they're happy is another story, but it's time to actually start bumping up the intensity of the workout."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"Um, because I have kind of plateaued."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"Again, that's, that's,"
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"Better than gaining, but, you know, gee, I really should be, you know, closer to 160 or 159 in my head."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"And now that I've spent the time kind of leveling off the calories and the fat, okay, I do really need to focus on getting a more intense workout when I do work out."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"Yeah, definitely makes sense."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"Your brain, your body does lose too much intensity."
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,So you said that as you're going to step up back.
Margaret/6067.D.w5.8.16.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,Thank you very much.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week six of the study."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,We'll be going over our regular agenda today.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"We'll also be talking a little bit kind of about your progress, motivation, things like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"So let's start off by going over lesson six, ways to stay motivated."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Yes, I looked at it last week."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"OK, great."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,Do you remember anything from that lesson in specific?
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Actually, at the time when I first... One of the reasons I was looking at it was because, you know, like we talked last time, feeling a little like, oh, I'm just kind of dragged down and I'm not sure what to do and just kind of little tips and tricks and things to keep motivated because, you know, the overall impression I got was that this isn't a fast process and it has to be..."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,specialized towards each person's needs.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"And that's why, oh, you'll think you'll have a great week and then the next week will just be kind of blah, but you can't let that week hold you back because that's how you lose motivation."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Yeah, you know, we do really, really encourage participants, you know, especially when they're thinking about joining the study, so, you know, way in the beginning that, like you said, this is"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"We want this to be sustainable, so we want this weight to come off and to stay off, not to be something like a yo-yo diet."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"So we know for a lot of people that's really frustrating because, of course, we want the reward right away."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,We want to see all that weight just come off.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,But it does take a long time.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,It's not the weight that people put on.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,It's not like you gain that all in one day.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"So to lose that and to build up these healthy behaviors, it's really hard."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,So you do need to do it over a long period of time.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Are you feeling, you know, kind of discouraged, you know, with your progress or is your motivation kind of low right now?"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,Last year was kind of a little low.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"There was, although towards the end of the week earlier this week, I kind of dipped down under 160."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"I kind of bounced back up, but that I managed to finally make under 160 and that I was able to do that for a couple of days made me go, okay."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"You know, that's actually the kind of second kick that I needed, and I did notice that once I started to really ramp up my exercising, and that does actually work."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"It still takes time, but it does actually work."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"So I just have to remember that it is a consistency, because like you said, the weight didn't come on all at once, which means it's not going to come off all at once."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Yes, exactly."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,And I wanted to point out one thing.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,So today I see that your weight is 161.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Yeah, so that actually means you've officially met your weight loss goal for the study."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"So I know generally people, you know, they want to lose a lot more weight than what we say."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"We try to choose a number that's, you know, just sustainable for this 12-week period because, you know, some people have a hard time getting into the program, things like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Everyone's different, but..."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"So just kind of moving forward, do you still want to continue losing weight or do you kind of want to maintain?"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,What are your thoughts?
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Oh, no, I absolutely do want to continue."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"I understand that certainly for my height and my body mass index, even though obviously now it's lower, it's not at a level that I know..."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,will sustain me for my health.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"You know, again, one of the reasons why I wanted to do this is because I don't...there's not a whole lot of medical issues in my family, but I do recognize that a majority of health concerns people have is due to or can be alleviated or even cured by their weight."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,This is something that I do want to address.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"you know, now, while I'm young, while I can actually get these goals into place, because the long-term, like you said, it's the long-term effects, and, you know, reading articles in the New York Times and the Washington Post, and it's the same thing where people do this, they'll do it for a year, they're excited, they'll do it for two years, they're excited, and then after like two or three years, the old habits will start to slip back, and then they'll gain the weight back, and that's"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,not what I want to do.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"The whole point is to get down to a healthier weight and maintain it because I do understand that that is actually what is going to keep me healthy, you know, keeping my weight under, not eating, eating properly, and regular exercise is what is actually going to keep me the healthiest, period."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Yeah, definitely."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"So just moving forward, you know, you're halfway done with this kind of initial part, but we'll just kind of keep checking up then on the goals."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,And we'll just kind of see where things go from there.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Your previous SMART goals, so you said you want to step up the intensity of your workouts."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,Were you able to do that last week?
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"Yes, actually, unfortunately, not unfortunately, on Monday I went downstate to go see the eclipse, which was fantastic, but it meant that I was in a car for a good few days, so I couldn't do anything on Monday."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"But I still try to get to the gym about three days a week, and I try to do, it's now anywhere from about,"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"about a half hour, 45 minutes of cardio and then about 45 minutes of jogging, walking."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"And even yesterday I did kind of kick that up to about an hour of cardio, not intense cardio, but a solid hour of cardio and 45 minutes of jogging and walking to try and just, because like I said, when it finally dipped to that 159, I went, oh gosh, this can be achieved."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,I really do need to exercise more.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"Yeah, so just looking at your physical activity, it still seemed really great."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"You know, across seven days last week, you did a total of 512 minutes."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"So just last week, you know, you were doing really great there."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"And still this week, you know, it still looks like you're doing well despite, you know, Monday being kind of low."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"So not, you know, too much there."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"No, no, no."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,That part is nuts.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"uh, a factor."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"The only thing I will say that coming up in about, um, although since I've reached my goal, this may not be such a big deal."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"Um, the week of the 10th through the 15th, I'm actually going to be out of town, um, on my honeymoon."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"So, yes, thank you."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"Uh, we're going, so we're going to, and I want to"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"say this now so it doesn't, like, pop up in, like, a week or two."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"So I guess, yeah, in about two weeks I will be down in Florida."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,We're going to Disney World.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"So my, even though I guess this will be my goal, like, next week or the week after, but, you know, I still do the meal replacements every day because I really do, I like that, and I think that that has really helped me."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"It's helping me figure out how to plan everything, which is,"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"Again, that's how you maintain it."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"I like having this time to actually figure out how to plan everything because I can test to see what works and what doesn't work without feeling like I'm under some enormous, crazy pressure."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"But that week, there will be food pretty much every day."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"So there will be a lot of walking, but I'm still going to keep everything on track."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"I'm going to try and keep myself as close to the goal as possible, but since it is the honeymoon and it's Disney and it's hot, so that week, I guess maybe that's week eight or nine."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"Just as a warning, those numbers are going to spike a bit simply because that's just going to happen."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,But I am...
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,hoping that with the amount of walking that will be happening i will at least be able to make it up in minutes yeah um you know i don't really think anyone takes those meal replacements on vacation with them especially to their honeymoon okay you know well i did i i did take them down with me to downstate for the eclipse oh that's nice yes i did so um and of course since you know this is an
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,"Especially, you know, a very special occasion, so you should definitely enjoy yourself."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,We'll kind of deal with that as it comes.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"I do, you know, I just expect it."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"Yeah, I just wanted to put that out there so it's not like, oh, where's all this stuff spiking?"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"She did so well, and then suddenly she's thrown off the numbers."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,"Will you still be able to do a call that week, or did you want to skip that week?"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,Um...
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,think that day that Thursday we don't have a whole lot planned but I'll know like the week before better because we're still kind of finalizing what we're doing we actually do have a day where we're not going to be running around doing park stuff and I think it is that Thursday but I'll have to double check yeah just let me know but until then we'll just try to do as best as we can
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,and kind of stick to the goals in preparation for that.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,"Again, your nutrition portion also looked really great this past week."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,So it's been eight days since we last talked.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"So out of those eight days, I saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories, seven of those days."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"And then you met your calorie goal, all seven of those days, and then your fat gram goal, five of those days."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,So
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,"Yeah, unfortunately, that did spike a little bit on the Monday and Tuesday."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,"Unfortunately, when you're downstate and your options are Burger King, you know, Pizza Hut, Steak and Shake, it's a little hard to keep the numbers down, which is actually why I wanted to bring the meal replacement with me, because I knew we were going to have stuff like that at one day, so I wanted to try and"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,"keep it down where I could, which, again, is why I actually do like the meal replacements very much."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"So, yeah, everything is looking good, and especially you did, I do see the 159 in your weight, so that does mean, you know, your weight is still trying to go down."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,"So yeah, everything is looking good on my end."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"Let's see, just to go over your components."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,"So still using two meal replacements a day, correct?"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,"Okay, and then are you still receiving those in-app text messages?"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"All right, then for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 7."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,That one is called Conquering Slip-Ups.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goals to be for the week?
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"Well, right now, what I do, I usually do the meal replacements for breakfast, lunch, and then I'll make dinner, except now that I'm at the gym more at dinner, I'm eating later and later, which is fine, but I still go to bed at my regular time, and I wonder if that's going, if that's kind of like eating late and then going to bed instead of being able to burn it off."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,"So I think, and I'm going to look at over this weekend about doing like"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,"a different meal planning schedule where I do, where I front load it, where I kind of flip it instead."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,"I'll do, like, I'll do, like, pre-made meals or freezer meals and then have that for breakfast and then lunch and dinner will be the meal replacements and see if that will help bring the numbers down a little bit so I'm not plateauing for as long as I am."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,"Yeah, that's interesting."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,"Yeah, I'm kind of interested to see what's going to happen with that."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,"But in theory, that should work, right?"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,But...
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,"Yeah, I mean, because I was reading, and again, I was reading in the New York Times that a lot of studies are popping up that, and it does make sense."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,"You have a big meal at the end of the day, but then you're not nearly as active, and then you go to bed."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,"And, I mean, yesterday I didn't have a huge meal, but, you know, I finished dinner at 8 o'clock, and then I was in bed by 9."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,132,patient,"That, you know, then it just kind of, so when I weigh myself in the morning, it just kind of, I think that might be one of the reasons why it kind of,"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,"hovers a little bit, so I want to try and do some freezer meals over the weekend."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,"And then that way I'll have, I don't have to cook breakfast, but I'll have breakfast ready, front load the calories on that end, and then do the meal replacements for lunch and dinner and see if that affects everything."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,135,advisor,"Yeah, cool."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,136,advisor,"All right, then for our call next week, so next Thursday is the 31st."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,137,advisor,That's going to be at 9.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,138,advisor,"Oh, I'm actually not going to be here next Thursday."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,Sorry.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,140,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,141,advisor,Are you available on Friday by any chance?
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,142,patient,"Friday the 1st, yes."
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,Do you want to do Friday at 9?
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,146,patient,Perfect.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,147,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,148,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,149,advisor,Then I will talk to you September 1st at 9.
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,150,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6067.D.w6.8.24.17.MD.MP3,151,patient,Thank you very much.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,So we are in week seven.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,We'll just be going over the regular agenda today.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"So lesson seven, conquering slip-ups."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Yes, I was looking through."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"They were talking about the difference between slips, slides, and falls."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,That's right.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"What they are, what they mean, what do they mean for"
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"you know, weight loss and recovery and how to prevent them and stuff like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"Yeah, do you feel like you've encountered, you know, a slip-up during your time in the study?"
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"Slips, yes."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,I don't think I've had any slides or falls.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"I mean, you know, obviously the... I think, you know, for weight loss, the most difficult thing for people is when you're going out."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,I talked a lot about it.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,I think it was in the previous lesson about...
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"not just going out to eat, but being around family and stuff like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"And I try to... I don't... We don't eat out a lot, but actually we did... Well, we did go out last night and, you know, just trying to learn what to do."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"You know, I find that the appetizer menu is pretty much the only place I can eat from, which is fine, but just learning stuff like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,I think slips are actually kind of a good thing in that...
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"If you recover from them, you can learn from them."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Yes, exactly."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"That's actually, you know, a really positive way to look at it."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"Some people really, you know, let them or let that slip, get them down."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,But I definitely agree.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"I think, you know, you learn a lot about yourself whenever you kind of slip up and ways, you know, to kind of prevent that from happening next time."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"So they can be, you know, valuable tools."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"Okay, let's see."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,Your previous SMART goal.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,So you talked about kind of wanting to switch up when you use the meal replacements.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"So instead of having it for breakfast, doing it for lunch and dinner."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,How did that go?
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Pretty good.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,I actually...
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"This week kind of got away from me from a couple of stuff, so I was able to... I wanted to focus more on breakfast or lunch."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"The dinner part was actually okay, except for, like I said last night, I've actually been good about making sure I end on the meal replacement because, like I said, I don't want to end the day on a meal because I get home so late at night eating later now because I'm at the gym so long, which is fine."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,So I tried to focus a little bit more.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"I couldn't really do the breakfast, but I tried to focus more on lunch, and I would like to actually try it again this week because I think that did help me a bit more at the gym."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,I wasn't as sore or tired because I ate earlier in the day like I had more fuel before I went to the gym as opposed to after.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"Yeah, so yeah, that's really interesting."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"I do think, you know, maybe switching up when you use the meal replacement can definitely help with like gym performance, especially if you feel like maybe you're running out of a little bit of energy."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"I think, you know, those having like that food in the day rather than later at night might help a little bit."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"And like you said, just"
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,general kind of switching things up.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,That's good.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"All right, then let's go ahead and go over your data."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"So as always, looked very good this past week."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,So it's been eight days since we last talked.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"So out of the past eight days, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories, six of those days."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"And then it looks like you met your calorie goal all six of those days, and then your fat gram goal four of those days."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"So really, really great job there."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"Physical activity, so just looking at last week, let's see, your goal was 300 minutes, and I see across seven days you did 451 minutes, so really great job there."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,It definitely looks like you stepped up the duration of that.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Yeah, I've tried to focus."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"So now that I've been doing it for a while, I'm a bit more focused on, like there are, I'm basically working on three things that I want to do."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,I want to
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,try running more.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,So I'm still doing that walk-to-run program.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,And I was able actually yesterday to do five sets of three-minute
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"straight runs, so that was the longest I was able to do that, so I was happy about that."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"Trying to do just generic more cardio kind of building off of the running, but also wanting to focus on specific areas like my arms and my back, so I've tried to break it down into sections."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"I'll do a half an hour just general cardio, maybe about a half an hour"
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"excuse me, of arms and then about 45 minutes worth of walking and jogging just to try and get all the stuff, all the parts together."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Yeah, and kind of how's the time management aspect of that going?"
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"Because, of course, you know, it is a substantial amount of time."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,So how's that been fitting into your schedule?
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"Um, it's been sitting in, that is also one of the reasons why I wanted to switch up the meal replacement stuff because I'm at the gym now for, you know, I started out about an hour, um, about three days a week."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"Now it's about two and a half hours, two to three days a week, um, which is why I wanted to, at least on those days, try to switch it up where I end the day at the meal replacement because, again, I don't want to, um,"
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"I got home at like 7.45 last night, which is fine, but then, you know, that means I'm eating at like 8.15, 8.30, and I did notice, since I did it that way, I didn't have, I had the meal replacement for lunch yesterday, and I noticed that it did actually take me a little bit longer to finish everything last night, which is, I think, why I got done so late, because I"
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"my body was like, yes, we want to eat during the day before we go to exercise, and I was a bit tired, and it took me longer to finish my sets."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"So, like I said, I do want to actually keep that for this week's goal because I really want to see if that... You know, the scientific method, it sounds like my body's happier having lunch, especially on days when I go to the gym, so try to switch that up so I can... Again, I want to make sure..."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,My muscles are okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,I'm not straining anything.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"I'm not hurting anything, which I haven't had a problem since I first started, but I just always want to make sure that that is in focus."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,Sounds good there.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,And then most recent weight I see 158.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,So that's three pounds down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"So sort of a big drop there, but, you know, as long as everything is going okay, then not too worried there."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"Like I said, I noticed that I was a little bit more sore yesterday because I think I didn't eat lunch."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,I did the meal replacement.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"So just, you know, each day trying to find out what works."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,"And then, let's see, the meal replacements, you're still having two a day, correct?"
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,Correct.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"And then are you still receiving those text messages from us, the in-app messages?"
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,"Yeah, whatever glitch was there seems to be rectified."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"All right, then for our next lesson, if you could go ahead and read number eight, that one is called Food Cravings and Queues."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,"It's pretty brief, so you just give a quick glance at that, and then we have your smart goal down."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"And then for our call next week, let's see, is it okay if we go back to our regular Thursday time, or do you need to switch it again?"
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,Thursday is fine for next week.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,The week after is when I'm going to be out of town.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,So next week on Thursday should be fine.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,"Probably the week after we'll, like I said, I think we're still finalizing plans, so I'll let you know if I'll be around around."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,That's for another week.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,116,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"Then for this next call, I will talk to you next Thursday at B7 at 9."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,Have a good weekend.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,"Oh, and a good Monday, since you probably don't work on that day either."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,I do not.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,"And I hope you have a good weekend, and I hope you have a day off, too."
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,Thank you very much.
Margaret/6067.D.w7.9.1.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in Week 8."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,We'll just be going over the regular agenda today.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,The lesson today was called Food Cravings and Cues.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Can you speak into that one?
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yeah, so going through it, it was talking about things in your life that causes cravings or stuff that will cue you into getting stuff like bakeries, cafes, watching TV, etc."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I saw that there was a lot of stuff on ways to avoid.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"There were a lot of things on there on how to avoid the queues and things to do, like keeping fresh fruit around."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"What I like to do is, like, do prepack of snacks that I know fit into the food category and, like, having those pre-made or prepacked and ready to go."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Um, cues for exercising, like keeping your stuff visible, um, having a calendar out, uh, and checking it off as you go along."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"Um, uh, what else?"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"Oh, urges and food cravings."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,That was one.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"The, the five D's."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"I don't remember all of them, but they did sound familiar."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,15,unknown,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,16,unknown,"And did you, reading that lesson, did you kind of recognize any of your own cues or cravings that you kind of struggle with?"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"Yeah, the good and the bad."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"The overall thing to, like, help to promote good stuff is, you know, the overall theme was, like, just don't buy it in the first place, which seems simple but is obviously, you know."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,is not because our brain still thinks about that stuff.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,I'm pretty good with stuff like that.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Um, you know, I, when I make my grocery list, it's more and more, uh, fruits and vegetables and stuff like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"And, um, for me basically cutting out, uh, carbs and dairy, not that I don't crave that, but since I do track everything on there and I try to be mindful of, um, the calories and the fat, uh,"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"That has helped me try to think of that, but I certainly do get, you know, thoughts and cravings about stuff like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"I just try my best to move along, drink a large glass of water and move along."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,25,unknown,"And then for your previous SMART goals, so we still wanted to kind of switch up the meal replacement."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,That's been good.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"I've modified it a little bit, so now on days when I know I'm going to the gym, that's the day where I will alter it and have my meal instead of the evening."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"I'll have it in the afternoon, so I have a bit more fuel when I go to the gym, and that has actually helped me out a little bit."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"I did that on Tuesday and Wednesday when I went to the gym, and I could notice a difference."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"just in my recovery, like later that day."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,So that's how I've kind of modified it right now.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,33,unknown,"Okay, then looking at your data, so it's been six days since we last spoke."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,34,unknown,"So out of these six days, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories four of those days."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,35,unknown,"Then it looks like you met your calorie goal all four of those days, and then your fat gram goal three of those days."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,36,unknown,Physical activity looked really great across seven days.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,37,unknown,"Yes No, I didn't you know still still doing pretty good my I"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"Actually, over Labor Day weekend, I was able to see some family and already started to talk about holiday stuff and things like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,So I'm kind of trying to start to get myself in a mindset of how to go through and navigate stuff like that.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Actually, going back to the lesson today, talking about..."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,food cues and stuff like that a lot of it was like TV and stuff around you but and I think this wasn't one of the previous lessons about you know holidays and friends and family and stuff like that and um
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"You know, my family, when we were over there for Labor Day, my mom, of course, made a lot of food, like I think some moms do."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,My mom is one of them.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"You know, kept asking me, are you sure you're okay?"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,Are you sure you're good?
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"I'm like, yes."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"I had planned on, because she had told me what she was making beforehand, so I was able to, like, decide, okay, what am I going to eat?"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,What am I not going to eat?
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,And I...
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,Not concerned.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"I think I, so far, I'm so good."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"My hope is that by the time the holidays come around, I will have locked it into my head that this is the way to eat now."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"But, you know, just trying to think about going ahead, going forward and stuff like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Like, you know, and it's the same thing about going out to eat."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,How do you eat?
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,Where do you eat?
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"Like, there have been a couple of times where I've gone out, I'm like, okay, I'm pretty limited here, so I'm going to have to..."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,playing around that.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,So just that's in the back of my head going into the holidays.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,60,unknown,"Yeah, and a lot of it is really, you know, exposure to those situations in practice, right?"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"Yeah, exactly."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"I mean, it's one of those things where, you know, I'm hesitant to go in there because, oh, blah, blah, blah, but at the same time..."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"I know I'll be better prepared to walk into a situation like that if I... You know, already, if we go out to eat,"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"I'm sure I brought this up, I pretty much look at either appetizers now or even if I get an entree, I try to make sure I don't finish it."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"So I have, you know, A, so I'm not going over, but also so, you know, that's one less thing I have to prepare for myself for the next day, which is actually kind of nice too."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,67,unknown,All right.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,68,unknown,Then just want to check in on some of your components.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,69,unknown,"So still using two of those meal replacements a day, correct?"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,71,unknown,"Okay, and then still receiving those in advance messages?"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,73,unknown,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,74,unknown,Then our next lesson is going to be number nine.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,75,unknown,"That one is called Stress Management, so pretty self-explanatory what it's about from the title."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,76,unknown,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,77,unknown,And then what would you like your SMART goals to be?
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"I'm not sure because I seem to be trying to focus on, you know, I've tried to focus, you know, doing more exercise."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,I was able to...
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"you know, take care of that, trying to, you know, change up the food."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"So I'm not really sure what would be a new goal simply because, you know, I think I've explored a lot of options unless, you know, maybe going back and then trying something again."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"I don't know, maybe because the new, with fall coming, you know, new food options are coming around because I think"
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"because it's winter and fall, heavier foods are going to be kind of coming into play."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"When it's summer, you don't eat so heavy."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,You eat kind of lighter stuff.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"I did start to introduce black bean soup instead, like vegetarian soups, which has actually been quite good."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"It's hearty, but it has low calories and no fat."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,So maybe try to explore more veggie options like that.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,"Yeah, I'm just not, yeah, because I don't, because when fall comes, you know, certainly in my office it's freezing cold."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,They're trying to find stuff to keep you warm.
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"You know, the first thing people go to do, you know, they'll run and get, like, you know, a mocha from Starbucks or, you know, there's a, you know, they'll get the baked potato soup and stuff like that, which are all delicious, but I'm trying to stay away from dairy and stuff like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"So maybe that, trying to look for more."
Margaret/6067.D.w8.9.7.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,veggie heavy options warmer veggie options going into fall so you know maybe that'll help supplement all the food that i would normally eat like you know mashed potatoes and stuff like that and then next thursday that is going to be the 14th at nine yes all right then i will check in with you then have a good weekend thank you you too
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, we are in week nine."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Just going over the regular agenda today.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"So lesson nine, stress management."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yes, I thought I had a lot of activities and things to fill out, so I sat down, took some time out, sat down to go through the whole list because I do recognize that stress is a"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,directly tied to eating.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"Yeah, so are you kind of saying that stress affects the way that you engage in healthy behaviors?"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,I think in general it does.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"It actually, going through the whole thing, because there were a lot of, it looked like there was a lot of, or not looked like, there was a lot of stuff about how to manage stress, what triggers stress, but also a lot of activities or activities"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"how to prioritize yourself and try to figure out, you know, what do you want to do and how it relates to your eating and things like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"And actually, it did remind me a few weeks ago, our office, I work at a law firm, and they decided to switch some software without really telling anyone or training anyone."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,Wow.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"We've been going through, and this was about three weeks ago, and it's still freezing up and it's still not working, but it's been the first week when..."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,things are crashing and just going nuts.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"And I did find myself not getting stressed, but like very frustrated, which I guess is kind of the same thing, maybe."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"And I did remember specifically like, that's it, I'm so upset, I'm leaving work and I'm going straight to the gym."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"And I was like, okay, I guess that was a good choice."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"Rather than just be angry and frustrated, I went and worked out for two hours."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,Wow.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"Okay, so you definitely found a way there to kind of"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"and things like physical activity, eating coffee, that has become one of the, like, one of your just go-to ways to relieve stress normally now?"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Yes, I mean, I try to, in general, I don't really, I'll get frustrated by things, but I also understand my relationships."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,choose a situation like this is this is the computer and it's going to break so I'm going to walk away for a bit and literally you know walk around the office once or twice and come back and then you know try again um I did I actually remember there was a lot of sections about doing meditation and stuff like that and I remember uh last year I had um
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"a particularly stressful situation where I would even, that's when I actually did start doing meditation and stuff, and it worked to some degree."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Actually, what I liked about the lesson for this week was that it did have all these things that you write out."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Doing the meal planning and stuff like that has, for me, helped a lot."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,It's just remembering to go back and
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,Look at it.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"I think a lot of people spend a lot of time planning everything out and getting it organized, and then, like, other things happen, and I forget to go back to, like, look at the meal plan."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,But having... Being able to...
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"Manage the things I know I can manage, at least for me, seems to help me deal with the stress and frustration."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"Like, whatever else happens, I know at, like, 7-15 tonight I'm going to have my meal replacement, so I got that taken care of."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Let's move on to the next thing, you know."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"Well, I actually did start to get some menu stuff happening."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"Unfortunately, over the weekend, I had a family emergency, so I wasn't really able to get to that."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"But this weekend, I actually do have a whole list of things."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Getting back on the weekends, I like doing the meal prep stuff."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"Again, I find that eating like a – not a big lunch, but instead of doing the meal replacement for lunch, having a meal meal and then a later snack before I go to the gym for me seems to really work."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"And so I actually kind of spent this week planning out, okay, what are some food things I can make over the weekend so I –"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,just make ahead so that way I'm not struggling.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"Like, on the three days I go to the gym, sometimes I can go and get takeout."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"And I'm fortunate that we have a cafeteria that does have things like a lot of, like, roasted turkey and just, like, boiled or rather steamed, like, green beans and broccoli."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"Like, you can get the chunky Chinese food stuff, but they also –"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"and junky pasta stuff, but they do have a lot of, like, fresh food there, so that has helped out."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"I just would rather make it at home simply for the fact that I know exactly what's in it, and that's always been kind of my deal."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"But I think this weekend I'm really going to – I have a whole list of stuff, one or two soups to try, because I kind of like doing a warm soup on days when I'm not going to the gym, but it's still –"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,Chilling without chilling with the wrong stuff.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"Okay, and then let's see."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Your data was really great this past week.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"Six days where you were eating at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"And then calorie and fat gram goal, all six of those days."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,444 minutes of physical activity across six days.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,So really great there as well in your goal.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,"And then most recently, your weight is 154."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"Yep, so that is three pounds down from the last time you checked in, so you're still doing very well, being very consistent with everything."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"You know, these calls are pretty easy and painless and quick because you're doing so well."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"I mean, it is broken down very easily, and, you know, taking it week by week, I do like that there are, even though I may, you know, search for a goal the next week, you"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"I mean, I just remember you saying one thing where, you know, you didn't gain all this weight, you know, in just a few months, but you're not going to lose it in just a few months."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"So just kind of actually keeping that in mind, I think that's actually a good mantra overall."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"Like, you know, in my brain I think I should weigh this much, but, hey, it didn't take me, you know, 12 weeks to get here, so it's not going to take me 12 weeks to get down there."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Let's just take it.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"One day at a time, like one thing at a time."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"You know, again, actually going back to the stress management, like what is a priority to work on this week?"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"Okay, cool."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,What is the priority of this week?
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,What is the priority for next week?
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,That's good to hear.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"You know, there is a lot of pressure with weight loss."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"It's kind of, you know, in a certain way, you know, especially for women."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"So I'm glad to hear, you know, that it sounds like you have a relatively, you know, healthy outlook and that this is working for you."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,So that's great.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"Then still using two meal replacements a day, correct?"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,And still receiving those in-app?
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,I'm still getting the app messages.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"The app, however, I've noticed, I don't know if anyone else has, it's been a little glitchy."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"I know there was an update, I think, earlier this week or late last week."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"But when I go enter in food, I'll try to type in water or coffee or something."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,"I'll type it in, and then I'll click search, and then it'll kind of freeze up a little bit, and then I kind of have to clear it out and put it to sleep and then come back a couple minutes later."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"And then it's working, so I don't know if anybody else is."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,It just seems a little glitchy since the update.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,"Yeah, that's strange."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,Maybe that's just me because my app has been a little glitchy during this process.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,95,advisor,It's okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,It probably is a system-wide thing because people maybe don't think it's important enough to mention.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,So is it only when you try to enter in food?
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"When I try to type in food to search, because I have a good, again, because I cook so much, I do actually have a fairly long list of, like, custom foods, and I'm having no problem there."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"But, like, I don't have a custom for, like, coffee or water."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"When it was summer, I was eating a lot of, like, watermelon and oranges, and I don't have a custom for that."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"So I'll, like, try to type in, like, navel orange."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,"and I'll click the little search icon, and it'll just kind of sit there and do nothing."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,"So then I have to close it out, and I'll even put the app to sleep for a little bit, come back and, like, refresh it, restart it, and then it's working fine."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,"But since the update, it'll do that to me, like, once or twice a day."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,"Yeah, I'll definitely let our tech developers know."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"Probably there's just another bug that needs to be sorted out, but thanks for letting us know."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"Okay, and then next lesson is number 10."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,That one is called mindfulness.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,"This one is basically just talking about slowing down when you're eating, trying to be more aware of the foods that you're eating, things like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,And then what would you like your smartphone to do for you?
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,"Well, I..."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,Exercise and gym is not a problem.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,"I've noticed the gym I go to, I'm usually there after work and they've started to do more classes in the afternoon, so I'm not able to focus like the same routine that I'm doing, which actually is kind of, I think, a good thing."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,So I think I want to start...
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,"What I normally would do is I'd do a lot of just cardio with, like, push-ups and jumping jacks and mountain climbers and a whole bunch of stuff like that."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"And then do my, like, running, jogging thing."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"So I think for the month of September they're having a lot of classes, so I have more limited time in the space."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"So I want to, like, explore other cardio machine options within the gym because..."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,"I think people, again, you'll get, I don't really enjoy doing the jumping jacks and all that stuff, so maybe try to find something else like the row machine or like the elliptical or something, like something that is, and also something that's not so heavy in tact, just because I know that the muscles get,"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,"where I'm told, and I think this is true, that the muscles, you know, you do the same routine over and over again, they'll get used to it."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,"So I think I just need to keep up the level of, the vigorous level that I'm doing, but try to find more things within the gym just to keep everything fresh, keep me interested, but make sure my muscles don't get too bored with what we're doing so I can maintain where I'm at."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,"And then, what's next?"
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,"Thursday is going to be the 21st, and our call is going to be at 9 a.m."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,Is that okay?
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,"Karen, then I will check in with you."
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,Wonderful.
Margaret/6067.D.w9.9.14.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,Thank you so much.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week two of the study."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,So glad we could catch up again.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"Really sorry about everything that has happened, but we're going to get you all up to speed here."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,So have you been keeping up with the lessons by any chance?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Yes, I've been going, I went on the, last week I saw the first lesson where you have a nice little box that says hello, does all the introductions to the program and all that stuff, and then on Monday I started looking through the ones, I think this week's lesson's about"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,Meals and meal planning and food and tips and tricks about what to and what not to do.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"So, so far with everything that you've read, has anything kind of stuck out to you or did you learn anything new?"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"Well, I've actually been doing a lot of home cooking myself for a number of years, so a lot of the information looks familiar, but it was just a good way to like, oh, I've been doing this for a while."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,I think I'm on track anyway.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"You know, I'm glad that to me it feels like, oh, good, I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing, I think."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"Okay, we can go ahead then and go over your data."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,So we'll go over your calories and fat grams first.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"So since we didn't talk last week, there have been 10 days since you started the intervention."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"Out of those 10 days, I see that you recorded at least 1,000 calories, five out of those 10 days."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,So about half the time...
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,So not bad by any means.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"However, remember we said that we want everyone to eat, you know, at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,We know that's a good number for your body to keep going.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,Especially it looks like you're getting in a lot of physical activity.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"So making sure you know that you feed your body so you're, you know, able to maintain your metabolism, things like that."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,And then looking at your calorie and fat gram goal.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"So your calorie goal is 1,200 calories."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Fat grams are 33 grams of fat.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"I see out of those five days where you record at least 1,000 calories, you met your calorie goal."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,Three of those days didn't quite hit your fat gram goal any of the time.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"That one, yeah, that's what I'm trying."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,That's my next thing to start working on because learning where the fat is is pretty much the next thing I'm trying to teach myself.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"So, do you feel like you've been struggling particularly with the fat grams?"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"Well, I've never counted fat grams before, so it's just a new thing to do."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,I don't know if I'm struggling so much as a...
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"Oh, that's where it is."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"Oh, that's where it's there, too."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"Like, I didn't realize that it's everywhere, which just means to me that I need to, again, pay more attention to fruits and vegetables, which obviously don't have a whole lot of fat in them."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"Yeah, especially, you know, you are on the lower end with that, with your goals."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"You know, on one hand, it means you have less weight to lose, but on the other hand, you know, you have to be very strict with yourself in terms of your food choices."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"So, you know, in general, looking at your, the foods that you've been entering, yeah,"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,pretty healthy overall you know nothing too bad definitely you know the almond butter is going to be the one that kind of sticks out to me the most um yeah and of course you know there are such things as good fat bad fat but you know with weight loss your body really doesn't take that into consideration it's going to store those yeah so yeah unfortunately um so yeah maybe you know i think just making a change here and there would definitely help but um overall nothing too bad
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"And with the calories, can you tell me a little bit about how that's been going?"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"Again, just trying to make sure I'm getting an uptick in fruits and vegetables."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"I always – learning where the – carbs are obviously the one that's going to – carbs are going to be the thing that gets me, but –"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"You know, trying to keep into the mindset of that we need to, it doesn't matter how tasty they look."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,They're just not good.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,That's why they're bad for you is because they're so tasty.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,Or whichever way.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,What I try to do is that I usually do make.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"you know, make food at home for breakfast, have food at home for lunch, or make my own lunch, make my own dinner."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,I usually try to not eat takeout that much so I can control that stuff.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,What I try to do is in the mornings when I'm
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,eating breakfast I'll put in my morning stuff when I'm eating in the morning and then since I've already made my lunch I'll put in what my stuff is for lunch and then that actually I I'm trying to see if that can help me plan out the rest of the day to try to get a more balanced like less fat and more calories if I already know like here are my two meals already in there so
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"for the, you know, I try to, and I'm trying to get, I have a snack in the morning, and I'm trying to get some kind of snack or something in the afternoon, and then trying to finish it out at the end of the day."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"I think that's a good way to, at least for now, I'm trying that out as a plan to move forward."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"I'm trying that out, I'm trying to, I'm tweaking it here and there."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,I think that's one of the reasons why
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"The calories are a little low because I do plan for low-fat, low-calorie, low-fat for breakfast, low-fat, low-calorie for lunch so that I can maybe have a better, more substantial snack in between to kind of like even out the food portions."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"Yeah, and since I cook at home for dinner for myself and my husband, I need to be a bit more conscious because there's just going to be more food."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,So I want to make sure that I give myself a little leeway at the end.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"I usually work out after work, so I try to have dinner just be a little bit more to, like, see the muscles afterwards."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,So that's currently what I'm working on right now.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"Yeah, it sounds like you're doing a lot of planning there, which is really great."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"You're already ahead of the game, and it sounds like you have a lot in mind in terms of calories, things like that."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"Right now, I would just suggest keep doing that, kind of playing around."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"Like I said, you're not doing bad by any means, but again, just making sure that you hit at least 1,000 calories, adding those fruits and vegetables is definitely going to help with that."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,I have trying to balance.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"For a long time, I would just do a big salad for lunch, but that, of course, gets tedious after a while."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"So, like, at dinner, if I'm doing, like, a lean pork chop, I'll make an extra pork chop and then have that for lunch but then not do the salad so I can, you know, do some, like, veggie sticks or something like that so it's not, like, the same thing over and over again, which I think is another way that people get discouraged and give up and such."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Okay, and then let's see."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"Last week, physical activity really great."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,All seven days you entered in something.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,You did a total of 520 minutes.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,So you really blew past that.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"Well, the building that I work at, they have a gym where it's a one-time fee for a year's membership is only $120."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Oh, wow."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"So it's kind of like, oh, okay."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,And it's right there.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"So I joined the gym, so I try to go at least three days a week to the gym."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"And then I, in general, just try to walk."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"I don't have a car, so I pretty much have to walk everywhere."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"So that helps out, but I think that's, you know, helping me at least stay active but not overly, like, too vigorous of exercise because this is getting my body, getting your body in shape first requires getting your body prepared to be in shape."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"And then just to let you know, your physical activity goal did bump up this week to 300 minutes."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,Did you see that in the app?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,I did see that.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"And actually I noticed, I went to the gym yesterday and I manually put in about 104 minutes and I didn't see that it calculated it yet."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,Yesterday?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"Like I see it, yeah."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"Like I see it, I see it like..."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,Because I went on the gym on Monday and I calculated its stuff and then it added up the minutes.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,I don't know if it takes like a day or two to process it.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,I just wanted to make sure that that got calculated.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"Yeah, that's a little unusual."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,You said you manually entered it?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"Yeah, so I did about 20 minutes of yoga stretching."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"I mean, so I did about 15 minutes, excuse me, of yoga, and then I did about a half an hour of, like, slightly faster-paced walking."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"I had the Fitbit on, so I think it calculated the time, like, the steps, but I don't know if it necessarily, like, I don't know if those two cancel each other out, but at least the yoga part I didn't see it got"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,I did not see that got calculated.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,So I don't know.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,"For yesterday, I see 56 minutes entered by the Fitbit."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"Yeah, okay, okay."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,"So maybe, but you also said you entered something in manually."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"What was, do you remember what the RPE you put in was?"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,"I'd have to, let me pull it up."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,Do you remember if you did 12 or above?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,I don't know if I did above 12.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,Would that be why?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,"Remember, we're looking for a certain level of exertion, so if you didn't do above 12, then we don't count it."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,I got what you're saying.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,"Okay, perfect."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"Okay, good."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,Just so I know that everything's working.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,"All right, and the most recent way I see is 166."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,"Okay, so, so far, so good."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,126,advisor,"You know, just a few areas to work on, you know, with the calories and the fat grams."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,But nothing too alarming right now.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,"You're only, you know, in the beginning of week two about."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,But is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or anything that you would like to talk about?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,"No, I think..."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,132,patient,"I looked at the progress thing and I was like, ooh, that's a lot of fat."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,"Okay, that's the next thing I need to work on."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,"So, you know, just trying to learn how to... For me, I need to learn how to have... Substantial is a relative term, but a substantial food intake while not having substantial fat intake."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,And that's...
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,"For me, not necessarily a challenge."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,I enjoy cooking.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,It's almost like a new cuisine to learn how to prepare for myself.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,139,patient,"I think that's why some of my calories have dropped a little bit because I'm trying to figure out how to balance the two, but I also do need to be mindful that I still hit the calories and"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,140,patient,"Once I hit the calories, I can work on fat because I need energy in general."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,141,advisor,"Yeah, like I said, you know, because you're at that low end of, you know, the calories and fat grams, it's going to take a little bit more effort on your side to kind of figure out what you need and how to balance that out in terms of, you know, balancing the calories and the fat grams."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,142,advisor,"But, again, already knowing that, you know, you cook your own food, you have a lot of insight into that, it shouldn't be, you know, too bad, just a little playing around here and there."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,143,patient,"Exactly, exactly."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,"Then for our next call, if you go ahead and read Lesson 3."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,146,advisor,Lesson 3 is called Adding Activity to Your Day.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,147,advisor,"You're not having any problem with that, so just go ahead and do a brief glance over."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,148,advisor,And then we can go ahead and set your first SMART goal.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,149,advisor,So have you ever heard of SMART goal setting?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,150,patient,"I've heard it mentioned, I think, in the orientation."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,151,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,152,advisor,"Yeah, so basically this is a goal that we're going to be setting every week."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,153,advisor,"It's behaviorally based, something that you feel like could kind of help push you towards this overall behavior change, healthy lifestyle, weight loss."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,154,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,155,advisor,So is there anything in mind that you feel like you want to work on from this call to our next call that will kind of help you along the way?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,156,patient,"For me, again, I'm going to go back to the fat gram because trying to, yeah, I mean, calories are great, but it's still fat is fat."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,157,patient,"That's got to get lower, too."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,158,advisor,"So do you want to say maybe from now until our next call, trying to hit that fat gram goal like three of the days to start out?"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,159,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,160,patient,I can do that.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,161,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,162,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,163,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,164,advisor,And then what time and day would you like to talk next week?
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,165,advisor,"If this day and time generally works for you, I can just keep it."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,166,advisor,"Otherwise, I can move it around if you'd like."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,167,patient,"No, this is fine."
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,168,patient,Thursday at 9 is perfectly good.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,169,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,170,advisor,"Then I'll talk to you next week, August 3rd at 9, okay?"
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,171,patient,Perfect.
Margaret/6067.F.w2.7.27.17.MD.MP3,172,patient,Thank you so much.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Alright, so we are officially in week one of the study, and then I just wanted to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Oh, right."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Alright, so first off, we'll be going over that lesson that I asked you to read, then we'll be going over all of your data, talk about your goals, then we'll go ahead and set up for our next call."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"So, lesson one, were you able to get to that one?"
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"You know, honestly, I haven't had a chance to."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I'm
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I've literally just got all my internet and everything hooked up late last night.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"So for our next call, I'm just going to go ahead and ask you to read two lessons, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,So then we can go ahead and go over your data.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"So since your intervention just started yesterday, I'm only looking at yesterday, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"So I see that yesterday you did record at least 1,000 calories, which is great."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"Remember, we encourage participants to eat at least that much, so you did do that."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"And then in terms of your calorie goal, so 1,500 calories and then your fat gram goal, 42 fat grams, it does look like you met both of those goals yesterday, so really great job there."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,How are you kind of feeling about those goals so far?
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,It seems pretty much okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"I think that, and not that I have necessarily a real typical day, but yesterday was probably a fairly typical, like, work day for me."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,So I imagine that's generally what most of my weekdays would look like.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"Okay, yeah, then if so, everything is going great right now."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Looking at your data, I think, yeah, you still even have a little bit of wiggle room in terms of calories and the fat grams, so definitely some room there to play around with."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"Let's see, physical activity looks good as well."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,"So I do see physical activity entered yesterday, a total of 56 minutes, so good job there."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,"Your goal for this week, just to remind you, is 60 minutes, but it looks like you've already surpassed that."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,So good job there.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,And then let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 192.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Is that what came over?
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"I wasn't sure if it would come over yesterday because I weighed myself in the morning, but I didn't have the Internet connection until late at night, so I wasn't sure if that was going to sink or not."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Yeah, I see the weight that we have."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,It says that it was entered today.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,But did you weigh yourself yesterday?
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,I did.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"But like I said, I wasn't hooked up to the internet at the time."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,So it might have just taken a while to come through.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,There's a little bit of a lag time.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"It does say that it is coming through the ARIA scale, so I'm glad that you were able to get that hooked up."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,Did you have any issues with that?
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"It took a minute to find my home Wi-Fi, but eventually we got it together."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"So since this is our first call and I'm only looking at one day of data, I don't have much to talk about right now or to point out, but is there something that you wanted to talk about on this call?"
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"I don't think so, not at this moment."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Yeah, like I said, everything looks great so far, so we'll just continue forward from here."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"So for our next call, like I said, if you would go ahead and get to lessons one and two, and then we can go ahead and set your first SMART goal."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,So did you kind of have an idea of what you would like that to be?
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,I really have no idea.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,So some small behaviorally based goal that you feel like would kind of help you achieve this overall goal of behavior change and weight loss.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,Is there anything in particular that you feel like you could maybe improve on?
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"So is that something that I would be putting in the app or just like, and like the app would track or just kind of any sort of behavioral thing?"
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"No, this is something that you and I would talk about on our coaching calls."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,So it's not really involved in the app.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Well, I actually had considered just as a way to increase activity, I moved into a building on the 14th floor."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"So probably not climbing up 14th floor, but possibly trying to make it a habit of going down, you know, in the morning or, you know, what have you when I'm going to work, something of that nature, but at least trying to do that like once a day."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"All right, then we can go ahead and set up our next call."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"So for next week, when would you like to talk?"
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,Is it possible for us to keep this Tuesday at 1 o'clock time?
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"Yep, that's fine."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,Or even like Tuesday at 2?
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,I could do Tuesday at 1.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,That works for me.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,Tuesday at 1?
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"If we can set that up for, like, regular, that would work out really well for me."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Yeah, no problem."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,Then I will check in with you on the 25th at 1.
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"All right, thank you."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6070.F.w1.7.18.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week 10."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Lesson 10, mindfulness."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,What did you think of that lesson?
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Yeah, I think it's funny because I had skimmed through it and hadn't read it really, really specifically earlier in the week."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,And then...
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"And then there was a radio commercial that came on, and they had one of the same things, like, it takes 20 minutes for your body to realize that you're full."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"And I was like, oh, that makes so much sense."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,So it was just funny timing.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"But, you know, I think that's..."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"I haven't usually had a lot of problems with the mindless, sitting in front of a television, munching sort of thing."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"But for me, I think the biggest thing is that I can get really fast to eat when I'm really hungry."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"So for me, I think a lot of that is about just being..."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"proactive and making sure that, like, I'm planning in advance and that I'm not, like, letting myself get to that point and, like, having snacks and stuff around."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,So that was a good sort of lesson.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"Just, you know, based on your data, it looks like you have a pretty good handle on everything."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,So just give me another one of those lessons that are kind of good to just keep in mind.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,So we had talked about stress a little bit last week.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"You had talked about wanting to kind of work on your stress, kind of get organized, things like that."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,So how did that go?
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"Yeah, no, I was able to kind of get to sit down and look at some, like, just doing some sort of planning and calendaring of some things and, like, making sure that I had some high-priority items."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,sort of up at the top of the list and was able to actually kind of start following through on a few of those.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,So I'm feeling really good and I'm feeling like I'm a little more organized and on top of stuff than I had been the last couple of weeks.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"So let's see, looking at your data, a week of really great recording, all seven days you did physical activity, 384 minutes, so you did meet your 300-minute goal."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"For the diet portion, all seven days where you recorded at least 1,000 calories, you met your calorie goal six of those days and your fat gram goal seven of those days."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"So really, really amazing."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 180.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,I got over the hump.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"Yeah, definitely."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"So, like I said, just, you know, with some diligence and patience, it looks like we pushed past that plateau, which is awesome."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"So, you know, these last two weeks or so kind of just go on as we are."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,But is there anything that you wanted to bring up on this call or anything you wanted to talk about?
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Everything looks really great now.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"No, I mean, I'm just... I'm feeling really good, and to be honest with you, I'm a little..."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,I'm impressed at where I'm at given the fact that this has been probably one of the craziest summers I've ever had in my entire life.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"Like, I've had so much going on, changes at work, changes in personal situations, you know, moving, like, all of this stuff is going on."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,And so I'm just really happy that I've been able to actually kind of stick with some of the stuff despite what has been a fairly...
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"rocky and tumultuous, you know, eight to ten weeks so far."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"I think the only other thing is, like, I'm... I have some... You know, we talk about doing smart goals, and I've had a hard time kind of thinking of them, of what to do sometimes."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"And I have some things that I want to do, but, like, I'm not..."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"I'm not quite in a place where I can necessarily do them over the next, like, week or two, but I know it's kind of on my list down the road."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"So it's like I have some plans for some things, but I need a minute, you know what I mean?"
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Is there a way that you could maybe, like, talk about those plans in steps so maybe you don't have to complete, you know, the entire thing?"
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,but like some small things.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"So, um, well, so I'd kind of been in this situation where I was trying to figure out where I could go do some workouts that, um, are, uh, more than like what the fitness center in my building has."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,And so I think looking at some options for that is something that I want to do.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Like, I've got to price some stuff out and things of that nature, and I need to get, like, budgeted and things."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,But I can probably do a little bit of research over the course of the next week.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"Like, that could be helpful."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"Yeah, definitely."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,And then just go ahead and take a look at Lesson 11.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,That one is called Balanced
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,And then let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"Next Tuesday, that's going to be the 26th at 1."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,Is that clear for you?
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"Yeah, absolutely."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"All right, then I will check in with them."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"Michelle, have a great week and keep up the good work, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"Okay, I appreciate it."
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6070.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week 11."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Lesson 11, balance your thoughts."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,What did you think of that one?
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,I'm sorry.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"I totally, completely forgot to look at it."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"I've had the craziest day, and I was like, I know I'm forgetting something."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,I know I'm forgetting something.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,"I'm going to ask you to read two next week, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"Yep, I'll get those last two taken care of before we talk next week."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"All right, and then your SMART goal."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"So you had said you wanted to look into some options from the perspective of outside, the exercise facility in your building, something like that."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"Well, I kind of win by default."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"So I think I've mentioned I've had a fairly crazy summer, and some of that has been because"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"I moved, like, literally right as the study was starting, and there's been a whole lot of complications."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,So I'm actually moving again next week into a new apartment.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"And it turns out that their building has, like, way better exercise equipment than the one I'm in."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"So I went to go visit it last week, and I was like, oh, this is perfect."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Like, I have a lot of options and a lot of ways to be able to, you know, kind of change things up that I didn't have before."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"So, yeah."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"And then, I mean, I think that once I get settled there, I'm still going to look at, like, some, you know, I don't know, gyms, classes, something in the neighborhood, you know, things of that nature."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,But I know I at least have some additional options right away.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"And when you do move, if you could just let us know what your new address will be."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Just in case we ever have to contact you for any reason or anything like that, just so we have your updated information, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"Do you guys do any kind of, like, check-ins when we do, like, the three and the six months and we come in?"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"Do you guys do, like, an information check?"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,We might.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,I'm not entirely sure.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"But, yeah, at the very least, if I forget before then, then I've got that appointment scheduled in, like, two weeks."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,So I'll make sure to get that all updated then.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"And then your data this week was really great, as always."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"All seven days where you record at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Met your goal six of the days, and then your fat gram goal all seven of the days."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"All seven days physical activity recorded, you did 389 minutes, so you did hit that 300-minute goal, and then most recent weight I see is 179."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,That sounds right.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"Another pound down, so still doing very well."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"How did it, with the app issue, how was recording?"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"Well, what I ended up doing was just going and finding the most similar item that was already in the list."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"Oh, man."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Because, I mean, I do... Huh?"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"Yeah, that just sounds, like, very tedious, so I'm sorry about that."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"Well, actually, you know..."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"I mean, I've used the custom stuff quite a bit because I cook a lot and I, you know, don't go to a lot of like chain restaurants and things of that nature."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"But I feel like after doing that for a while, like I've gotten good at like going, okay, here's something I did."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,There's like five choices.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Let me look at the one that, you know, looks to have about the same like nutritional value."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,Maybe changing up the portions a little bit to like make the calories and fat grams kind of hit.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,But it actually wasn't awful.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"So I think it worked out okay for me, just with respect."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"I know that the exact items aren't exactly the same and the exact portions aren't exactly the same, but the caloric and the nutritional information seemed to be, I was able to find that and get that taken care of pretty easily."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"So, yeah, you know, like I said, everything is still looking very good."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"So you're obviously, you know, past your goal."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,So not really much to comment on there.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"But like I said, for our next call, go ahead and read lessons 11 and 12."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for next week?
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"Well, I do have a question."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"Is next week the last time that we'll talk, or do we still talk in two more weeks?"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,Because in two more weeks is when I'm actually coming in for my three-month –
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,follow up as well yeah next week will be the last time that we have a call um okay so my goal then I guess going into next week and then the week after that is to um find replacements for the stuff that I'm borrowing from you guys um like the like I've already got uh my own activity tracker because I've got a smart watch um
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,but I haven't owned a scale in almost my entire life and never had any interest in actually stepping on one on a regular basis.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"So I probably want to at least, like, do that at minimum on a weekly basis."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"And I also want to find a food tracker app because, for me, I think the –"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,Number one thing that has helped me the most in this entire last 10 or whatever weeks has been the food tracking and keeping on top of that.
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"There's other pieces of it that I think have helped too, but if I had to choose the one that's been the most influential, it's been sort of that data and that education."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"So I want to make sure that I have an app, and I've done some research on the various apps out there so I can put something on my phone and keep moving with that."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Okay, and then for our call next week, so next Tuesday is the 3rd at 1, is that okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"Yes, but if I don't answer, please be patient because that's actually my moving day."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"I expect them to basically be finished up by about 12, 1230, you know, and you and I usually aren't on the phone all that long, so I'll try my best to"
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,catch it if for some reason the movers are still running around but um if they happen to be leaving at that time or something i'm signing paperwork then i'll keep an eye out for you and call you right back okay sounds good um i do want to let you know our call next week might be just a little bit longer than normal just because it is our last call so we just kind of want to talk about you know uh make a few last notes on some things talk about what worked for you and things like that okay okay yeah absolutely great then i will talk to you then have a good week good luck with moving okay okay thanks
Margaret/6070.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,Bye bye.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"All right, so week 12, this will be our last call."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be auto-recorded."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Did you happen to get to lessons 11 and 12 by any chance?
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I'm trying to remember which ones they were.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,There was the mindfulness one.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"Yes, balance your thoughts and weight loss plateau."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the plateau situation."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"which I kind of already, like, had that little hump and had gotten over, it seems."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"So I think there were some good tips in there, so I can be thinking about that moving forward, too."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"All right, and then your SMART goal."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"So you had kind of wanted to look into other options for the tech that we gave you, so, like, an activity tracker, buying a scale, things like that."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,How did that go?
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,Right.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,So I...
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,I like had you on speakerphone for a second.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,I'm trying to get you off speakerphone.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,So I had found like a list of a whole bunch of different apps.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,that had all sorts of different features.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"And so I found a few and just kind of like dug in to see what they were like, what kind of reviews, this and that."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"I wasn't loving all of the options that I eventually came up with, but there's one that I already have on my phone that I think I can use because it'll already like connect with other things."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Um, until I find a better one, but I think that'll do."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"So I'll be, I'll be able to easily like transfer over to that."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"Um, and then, uh, I started looking at, uh, scales too, and I found one."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Um, so I just need to order it and get it here by next week."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Then looking at your data.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"So again, another great week, six days where you report at least a thousand calories, major calorie and fat gram goal, six of those days."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"Across seven days, you did 388 minutes of physical activity."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"So, of course, you did meet your goal."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 177.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"So still losing weight, still doing very well."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Despite all the craziness, you know, it still looks like you were able to stay on track, which is awesome."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"Oh, my God."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,So I just kind of wanted to check in.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"You know, since this is our last call, you've lost 17 pounds since you started the intervention."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,How are you feeling about your progress?
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"Yeah, that's, I mean, it's a lot."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"I don't really, like, think about it being a lot, but, you know, it's only been a few months and it feels gradual, but I think that's good for me."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"And I'm sure that's just good in general for people that, you know, it's not like this rapid thing."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,loss versus um and then potentially like gaining all back again so i feel like um it's been good it's been gradual it's been you know fairly steady over the course of time so it seems like something very manageable to keep moving on yeah and in terms of you know moving forward how were you thinking of going about doing that um
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Well, definitely by continuing to keep tracking the, uh, the food."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"Um, I think that's, that's like I said, the other, like, like I think it was last week at the week before, like that to me has been probably one of the most beneficial pieces is just like the education aspect of that."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"Um, I'm, I'm a data analyst by trade."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"So, uh, having that data at my fingertips is very, very important."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"Um, um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,So that's definitely one thing I'll keep on top of.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"And then, you know, like I had mentioned, like I had – I moved into this building, and I've got some sort of a better –"
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"Sit in this room so I know that I can kind of change up what I'm doing and be able to, you know, add some different things over a little bit here and there."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"And then when I get a little bit more settled and the winter starts coming around and I don't get to spend as – or I'm not spending as much time outside more often, I'm going to look into some, like, classes in the neighborhood, you know, spinning or something, you know?"
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"I don't know what yet, but yeah."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"You know, we kind of just want to let people know that, you know, after your three months or I guess after this call, you know, it's going to be a little bit different since you are still in the study."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"However, this these coaching calls, you know, will no longer occur."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"But, you know, there are always ways to check in with yourself and keep yourself accountable outside of having someone, you know, call you on the phone once a week."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"You know, always doing weekly check ins with yourself or, you know, in your case, you know, you are tracking, which, like you said, that data is very helpful to kind of see trends."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,63,advisor,"And just looking at your progress, and you know, we are going to, you do have access to the lessons, so if you ever feel, you know, the need to read any of those ever again, you definitely have that."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"And even setting, you know, a goal for yourself once a week, you can definitely do that on your own."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"Or if you even feel like, you know, you can find someone who you can talk to once in a while just about these things, that's definitely feasible as well."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"But kind of how are you feeling, you know, going on your own for the rest of the intervention?"
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"Yeah, no, I think I'll be okay."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"Like I said, I think I feel like I've got, you know, some ways to keep things moving in the sort of short and midterm."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"You know, there's definitely some tools there when the holidays start to hit."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,Things of that nature.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"I feel like I probably work better when I'm doing goals that are,"
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,like three to four weeks at a time instead of like weekly because I know that it takes me time of like really focusing on something for it to become sort of a permanent change so I probably will kind of make some modifications to the way I'm kind of looking at that aspect of things but I think I'm feeling good about it and then you know if I ever really need someone to hit me over the head I can just call my mom and she'll do a really good job of it
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"All right, then."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"Of course, no more lessons for us to read."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,Did you want to set one last goal for yourself?
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Oh, goodness gracious."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,I hadn't even really thought about it.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,It's up to you.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,You don't have to.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"Yeah, no, I mean, I think I'm good."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"I think I, you know, I know when I get too..."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"Tuesday, I think is when I have my, uh, my appointment, my three month appointment and I come in and I do sort of, uh, I'm assuming they're going to do like, you know, all the measurements and weigh in again."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"I actually want that to have hit a 20 pound mark, but I don't know if that's gonna, I don't know if that's going to happen, but that's, I'm just going to keep working really hard this week, um, on making sure that that all comes about and, uh, as best as possible."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"And I have a lot of social events going on this week, um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,because there's a lot of sports going on this week.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"So if anything, I guess maybe a goal is just to try to keep within all of my data stuff, even though I'm going to be out at all sorts of sporting events most of the weekend."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,well then I just wanted to say you know it has been an absolute pleasure talking to you you know we do recognize that behavior change and weight loss is very difficult you know we always just say meet these goals do these things you know but we know that involved with that and you've been very consistent with meeting the goals you know you've made my job very
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"And for you guys, with the study, I realize that we're on the very sort of beginning portion of it, and I have no clue what the heck you're doing for five whole years, but I'll find out eventually, I guess."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,So good luck to you guys.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Thank you so much.
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,"Then have a good week, and we'll see you next Tuesday."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w12.10.4.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,Thanks.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,So we are officially in week two.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to lessons one and two by any chance?
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Yeah, I was able to finally get in there and take a look at them this morning."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,Did you learn anything new or anything that you liked?
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,Um...
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Oh, I don't know."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"I mean, I think that the stuff in those first two is stuff that I've probably mostly looked at myself, you know, online and in various ways."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,So I'm not positive that anything was really super kind of standing out to me as being new information.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"You know, a lot of the initial lessons are review, you know, especially if you have, like you said, decent working knowledge of healthy behaviors."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"But regardless, glad that you took a look at them anyway."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"Let's see, your previous SMART goal."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,So you had talked about the stairs at your home.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,"You had wanted to make sure that, you know, you kind of took those once in a while."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,So how did that go?
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"Yeah, pretty good."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,Almost every day this week.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"Yeah, I think there's a couple days I did it, and then there's a day I did it twice."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"So, yeah, I feel pretty good about it."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,"So to go over your data, just to remind you, we always look at the previous week's data."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,26,advisor,So we now officially have a full week.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,So I'm looking at from the 17th of July to the 23rd.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,"So across this seven-day period, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories six of those days."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,And it looks like you met your calorie goal four of those days and your fat gram goal four of those days as well.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,So definitely doing decently.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Go ahead.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,I was just going to say the one where it didn't record a thousand was the one where I'm having the problem that it won't let me add food to the previous day.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,I was going to bring up on this call it seems that we pushed out the update 71 but there's a little bit of a lag I guess with the Google Play Store so that should be updating soon and then that problem should be fixed but it's no big deal you know that one day it's okay if you didn't record at least a thousand
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Okay, well, it should have been, but... Yeah, I just couldn't get, like, my breakfast in there once I... I mean, I figured out the glitch I was having with adding custom foods."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"I mean, I don't know."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"I think the app is still being glitchy, but I figured out the way around it to make it happen."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"By the time I figured it out, it was the next day, and then I'm still having that issue with not being able to add to the previous day."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,So that's why that one day shows...
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"Like, you know, I barely ate."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"Yeah, no problem."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,That custom food bug will also be fixed in the next update.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So, you know, hopefully this will kind of take care of all the major problems."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"But, you know, definitely continue to let us know if you're having any other issues, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,Sure thing.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,So let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Yeah, looking at the calorie and fat gram goals, you know, decently meeting those."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,Are you having any issues trying to stay within your goals or anything like that?
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"Um, you know, I think the only, like, well, there's two big things, and one's, I think, just a natural part of this is it's actually sitting down and logging all that stuff."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,It's educational.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"And so there's definitely been a couple of moments where I've put something in and I've been like, oh, my God, like, that's way worse than I ever expected it to be, right?"
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,But that's good because then I'm identifying that stuff.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"right away and I know that, you know, how to make, you know, I can think of ways immediately to make adjustments."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,Right.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"Um, so that's kind of an easy problem."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"I think the other just bigger issue is just like, you know, weekends and stuff because like this past weekend I had events going on this next weekend."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"I've got a trip scheduled out of town, you know, so I know that I've got more, um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,eating out some of these events are a little bit beer focused so I know that I've got like this thing on the weekends where it's definitely especially in the near term a little more indulgent you know than like maybe my daily week my weekday habit and I think it's just something that I have to like think about and try to plan for and
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"you know, as best as I can."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"Yeah, you know, the whole weekend mindset isn't uncommon."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"You know, a lot of the times, in general, like you said, there are a lot of things going on on the weekend, but also, you know, people just think these are days to relax, kind of, you know, let go a little bit."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"But like you said, identifying ahead of time that there are going to be situations where you might have to make difficult food choices and preparing for those, you know, ahead of time is definitely helpful as well."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"So in the end, I guess my question is just more around the fact that is it about the sticking within that daily or, you know, sticking within that weekly as far as, like, averages are concerned?"
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"You know, like, had a really bad day but had a really, really good day, and they still averaged out to be sort of under, you know, under the goals for the week kind of a thing."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"That's kind of a difficult question to answer, I guess."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"Um, you know, overall recognizing that there are going to be certain days where you don't meet your goals and that's going to be natural, but also not getting into the mindset where, you know, every week it's okay that you didn't, you know, there are days where you didn't, just letting that slide all the time."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"Um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"I think a good mindset would be to realize that, like I said, there are going to be days where you don't meet your goal, just recognizing the next day to kind of pick yourself back up, not letting that become habit, you know?"
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,74,advisor,"For physical activity, really great."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,I saw seven days.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"You did a total of 361 minutes, so completely blew past that 60-minute goal."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"I was kind of laughing about that with some friends because I was like, I live in the city and just between normal walking back and forth from, you know, places where I tend to like push hard anyway and whatever like household stuff, I'm like, I'm going to hit the three month goal in the first week."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"Yeah, you know, those physical activity minutes definitely do add up."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,And you probably saw that your goal bumped up to 300 minutes this week.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"Hopefully, you know, you have no problem meeting that."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"Like you said, you do a lot of walking since you live in the city, so that shouldn't be too bad."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,And then most recent weight I see is 190.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,"Um, yeah."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"190 or 191, somewhere in there, so."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,"Yes, um, I see 150 on our end, so that's two pounds down from the last time we checked in, so, uh, definitely doing well, um, just continue to keep doing what you're doing, um, and yeah, we'll just go from there."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,94,advisor,"Um, okay, so for that next call, if you could go ahead and take a look at lesson three, that would be great, and then what would you like your SMART goal to be for this week?"
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"You know, these are going to be hard for me to come up with."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,I don't know if you have any suggestions.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,"Generally, we like people to kind of think of these on their own because it really is supposed to be, you know, a space for you."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"But usually what we tell people, you know, there might be something within either, you know, it doesn't have to be calorie or fat gram or even physical activity related, anything that you feel like would help, you know,"
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,push you towards healthy behavior change.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,It could be sleep-related.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"You know, something that you feel like you could improve on in a one-week period."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,It really could be anything.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,"You know, actually, that sleep-related one kind of makes sense."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,"I know I'm going to be out of town over this weekend, so I know that I'm going to have, like, just such a weird schedule for the entire weekend, Friday, Saturday, Sunday."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,So...
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,I don't want to put anything that I know I'm going to... It's going to be almost impossible to keep to.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,"But I will say, like, I've been using a sleep tracker for a while."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,"And this last couple of weeks, I've had a lot going on, and I know I haven't gotten as much sleep."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,"So, yeah, I could totally see, like, trying to get myself to bed earlier at night."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,"You know, that I could probably use another 30 to 45 minutes a night to really..."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,"feel well-rested, and make sure that I have enough energy the next day."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,So that's actually not a bad one.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,I think I'll take that.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,"And then for our next call, so if this day and time generally works, next Tuesday at 1, would that be okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"Yeah, that's perfect."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,117,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,118,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,119,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"All right, you too."
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6070.F.w2.7.25.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,"All right, bye."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week three of the study."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Let's see, lesson three was called adding activity to your day."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"Okay, and what did you think of that one?"
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"No, it was a good reminder of kind of like, I don't know, I guess..."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"reasons why maybe I've been, you know, less active than I used to be when I was younger, things of that nature."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Just kind of a good reminder that, you know, I need to sort of build back up again."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"So, yeah, it was good."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,"Yeah, in terms of physical activity, I haven't really, you know, you've been meeting that goal very well."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"You know, your goal for this week was 300 minutes, and across seven days you recorded 308."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"So, yeah."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"when you say, you know, you're not as active as you used to be, do you just mean like in general?"
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"Well, I guess, um, more on the, like more intensive prolonged, right?"
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,Like most of those minutes are going to be things that are already incorporated into my daily routine.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"It's,"
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"You know, walking to and from the train station or this and that."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,"And, like, I do a lot of walking in the city and, you know, other things like around the house or what have you."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,And I definitely push myself so that I'm sort of doing those things at a brisker pace.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"then, you know, in order to sort of amp that up a little bit."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"But I'm not, like, necessarily... I haven't been necessarily going and working out or, like, really, you know, doing, you know, like, biking or anything, like, you know, that's more intensive."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Or I used to play a lot of, you know, team sports when I was younger, that kind of thing."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,So...
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,That's something that I think I need to do better at incorporating.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"I'm hitting the minutes, but it's not necessarily that more intensive, prolonged kind of activity."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,27,advisor,"Is that a goal that you wanted to get out of the study, to do more intense physical activity, things like that?"
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"Yeah, I think that little by little that this will be a good way for me to sort of"
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,build some of that into my routine.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"Um, you know, I think one of the things is, you know, it's easy to be like, I'm going to go start doing this or I'm going to go get the gym membership and then people burn out really quick."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"Um, and I know that like that, that would be difficult given my lifestyle, but that, um, you know, over the course of three months, it'll be, you know, better for me to kind of use the opportunity to, to kind of build up a little bit more into something, um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,Just more sustained.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"And I'm really sorry I'm, like, at the red line, so you're probably hearing train noise."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Oh, no problem."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,And then let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Your previous SMART goal, so you said you wanted to go to sleep earlier."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Were you able to do that this past week?
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"A little bit, but not as well as I would have liked to."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"There were certain days where that just wasn't feasible, and then there were definitely a couple of times where..."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"I did, and then I was sleeping fairly restlessly."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"But I think that's just, like, some stress and stuff, things going on."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,So it's something I want to keep working at.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,great uh then let's see looking at the diet component of your data uh this past week so i'm looking at from let's see the 25th until yesterday the 31st i saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories all seven days you met your calorie goal four of the
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,doing pretty decently with the calorie and fat gram goals um just wanted to kind of check in how those are going have you made any changes in your um general like diet things like that
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,I think some little things during the week.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,I know kind of average out.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,I think I felt really good over the course of the week.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,I know that this week was more difficult just because I had a trip out of town planned.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,"That's something that I do every year, and it's just one of those indulgent weekends."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,So I tried really hard.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"to stay where I could, but I knew that there were going to be moments where I was going to go over."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"But I think during the week, I've been just making some different choices, and I think it's good with the app that you can kind of see."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"So there's information there that I didn't necessarily have at my fingertips before, and so it's kind of helping for future choices."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"All right, and then most recent weight I see is 189."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"Yeah, I was having a little bit of trouble with the – I've been having a little bit of trouble keeping the connection to the scale."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"A couple days late last week, it didn't sink, and then I was – like I said, I was gone over the – I was out of town over the weekend, so there was at least two days where I wasn't –"
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,anywhere near a fail.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"But I ended up having to manually reconnect the connection again this morning, and so I'm not 100% sure why I'm having that trouble, but..."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"But that is, I think, from this morning."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"I think I finally got it to sync, so yeah."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,"Yeah, I do see the 189, and it does say it's from the Aria, so it looks like it's synced up okay."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,I'm also not sure why that might have done that.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"Yeah, I'm sorry about that though, that it's being kind of troublesome for you, but looks like it's coming through, so that's good."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"So that is a pound down from the last time we checked in, so definitely right where we want that, that steady one to two pound weight loss, so everything is looking good."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,How is this upcoming week looking for you?
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,I think good.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,"I think that I have less weird stuff going on as far as, like, my schedule and my calendar."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,Yesterday looked fine.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,Today seems to be moving in the right direction.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"some more opportunity to, like, gig."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"So I've been taking, you know, on a few days at work, I've been taking, like, this two-minute break and trying to get out and get a little walk in."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Now that I'm kind of getting settled into my new apartment, I'm near the lake, so I'm, you know, thinking about, like, trying to find ways to get out and, you know, walk the lakefront or what have you."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,So I think I'm going to be able to start getting into a better routine as far as that's concerned.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,Good to hear.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"And yes, I know with the moving and then you were busy for a while, so that was a little bit of a concern for you."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"But it looks like, you know, now that things are slowing down, you're meeting the goals pretty consistently."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,So all seems well on our front.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,"So for our next call, if you could go ahead and then read Lesson 4."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,That one is called Making Smart Food Choices.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"So just kind of discussing some situations, food choices, and"
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,options for issues as well.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"Well, I think probably actually two small things."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,I think I want to keep working on the sleep goal just because last week was really difficult and it's just something I need to keep concentrating on.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"Like I've been doing the, you know, taking the stairs down from my 14th floor apartment."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,I got to start tackling up.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"So I think a way to just sort of modify that a little bit to kind of build that is going to be to, okay, when I leave, I'll go up."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"Go down, right?"
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,So just kind of like slowly building that routine in.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"I think I can work on that during this week, too."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"Then for our call next week, so let's see, that is going to be the 8th at 1."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,Next Tuesday?
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"Yep, absolutely."
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6070.F.w3.8.1.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,Have a great week.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, we are in week five of the study."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be recording for these calls."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Lesson five, that was called Navigating Social Cues, Gatherings, and Holidays."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Yes, and it came with perfect timing because I had a family reunion over the weekend."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,"Oh, how did that happen?"
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Well, it was fun."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,It was interesting because...
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Like, I made sure that I read that lesson in advance of going, because you know how it is, like, you get with family, everybody's got all their, like, food traditions, this and that."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"So I had this, like..."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,Mega plan for attacking that.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,I did fantastic with it and then realized that I was nowhere near as active during the entire weekend as I expected to be because I hadn't been thinking about it.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"So I'm like, yay, food."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"And then I'm like, oh, shit, I haven't moved much the last two days."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"So I didn't even think that was going to be too much of an issue because we're at a park, we're running around, we're doing this, we're doing that."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,But it turned out to be the issue.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,16,advisor,"Yeah, looking at your physical activity, you know, compared to normal, it did go down a little bit, but you still did something all seven days, and you did a total of 328 minutes, so you still surpassed your 100-minute goal."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"Yeah, and I was, like, working on it during the week, and then the weekend was just kind of, you know, but on average for the week, I know I did all right."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"And then, let's see, your SMART goal, you had said you wanted to do at least 10,000 steps every day."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,So I guess that's where you just kind of fell short.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"I don't really see 10,000 every day."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"And it was really, well, and maybe, you know, if it was like eight on one day, then I like made it up the next kind of a thing so that at least I averaged out to that."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,But it was definitely the weekend that like pulled me down.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,And I've got a couple of different apps that are doing the tracking right now.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"One, I get like a weekly summary and I think it was like 88 or 8,900."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,So I definitely want to continue with that goal this week just to kind of
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"make sure that I'm still, like, getting in that habit and, you know, I just, like, I just want to hit that one before I move on."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,You know what I mean?
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"Yeah, exactly."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,You want to solidify that.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,Understandable.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,"Looking at your nutrition data, so I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,It looks like you met your calorie goal four of those days and your fat goal six of those days.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"So, you know, definitely considering you were with family, really great job there."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,"Kind of in specific, what did you really do to kind of keep yourself accountable?"
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"Well, so it was over the course of two days."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"And so I knew there's just like when I go back home, there's specific foods that I know that I got to eat."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,So I wanted to make sure that I was like spreading that out over two days and not –
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,Not just one.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"And then one of the things I just did is I literally, because we always do like a potluck and everybody's got their, you know, their pastas and their this and their that."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"I was just like, okay, I'm going to have two bites of this, two bites of this, two bites of this."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"And then, you know, know that I got a little taste of everything."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,But I wasn't like doing it on any of those like really heavy foods.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,So it seemed to work.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,That's great.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,And did you feel deprived at all of anything?

Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"So yeah, it sounds like you found a really good way to kind of, you know, still participate and eat those foods that you like, but not going overboard, which is great."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"You know, that's exactly what we kind of want to target here."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,You definitely shouldn't have to sacrifice the foods that you want to eat.
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,"But of course, moderation is always the key."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,56,unknown,Yeah.

Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6070.F.w5.8.15.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,We are in week six.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Lesson six, ways to stay motivated."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Did you get to that one?
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Yeah, I did take a look at it."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,6,advisor,"Yeah, like I had mentioned on our last call, you know, this one I just kind of want to check in with you a little bit since you are, you know, halfway done with this initial kind of leg of the study."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"So kind of in general, you know, how are you feeling about your own motivation?"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"Um, pretty good."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"I mean, I was actually, like, telling some people not too long ago that, like, for me, I feel like having the app and having that information kind of always in front of you is actually really helpful because..."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"I don't know how, you know, other people are using it, but I tend to, um, put in my food, especially like pretty quickly, like after I have a meal."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"So like, I kind of always know, like, what do I have left for the day?"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"You know, it's kind of like the Weight Watchers points or something, right?"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"Like, you know what your limit is."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,So that seems really helpful.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"And then, um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"With some of the things that I've done over the last few weeks, you know, I can see kind of what the results have been, and, you know, knowing, like, you know, if I hit these goals and I hit these different things, like, I'm actually seeing those results."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"So that's been really helpful, and that in and of itself, I think, has kept me fairly motivated."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,"Yeah, that's awesome."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,"You know, we always encourage participants to record in real time."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"That's, like you said, going to be most helpful in keeping you accountable, so..."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,That is great.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"Then let's see, your previous, Marco, so you had wanted to do 10,000 steps every day."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,How did that go this past week?
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"So, you know, I have actually my own tracker, too, on my watch, which is, like, through a different app, which actually isn't always the same as what's on the Fitbit."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"Sometimes it's more, sometimes it's less."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"But that one actually had me at, like, over 78,000 steps per day."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Like, the week."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"I think the week is, like, Sunday through Saturday instead of Monday through Sunday or whatever."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,But I felt really good about it.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,I did want to mention my Fitbit battery died.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,And I was not in town.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,So there's a couple of days where it wasn't syncing.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"That was, I think, like, part of the day Monday."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,Or it was maybe part of the day on Sunday and then all day Monday and then most of the day Tuesday until Tuesday night.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"So if you see weird blips in the data, that's why."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"And I finally got it switched out last night, so... Great."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,Overall...
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,It seemed like you were doing really well with the steps.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,40,advisor,"You know, generally it looks like very close to 10,000 or above that."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,41,advisor,"There was even one day where you were at 20,000 steps."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,"So doing really, really great there."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"And for the rest of your data, still looking very good as well."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"So for physical activity across seven days, you did 416 minutes."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,So you did meet that.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Oh, wow."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"For the diet portion, you recorded at least 1,000 calories all seven days, and you met your calorie and fat gram goal six of those days."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"So really, really great job."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Most recent weight I see today, 184."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Does that sound correct?
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,So that is three pounds down from the last time we checked in.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,Do you feel like you did anything in specific this past week to really keep you accountable?
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"Um, well, yes, but it wasn't necessarily on purpose."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"I, uh, I have an event I'm going to tomorrow and I had to do some major shopping because it's like very specific, like clothing and things that I have to like buy and bring."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"So I literally was, I was literally downtown all day Saturday and a good portion of the day on Sunday, like running around Michigan Avenue and state street and like,"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,all over the place in and out of stores.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"And I got home the first day and I was like, maybe I should become a personal shopper for people because I obviously get a lot of physical activity by like running around shopping all day long."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"But really, in general, I think, you know, and I probably mentioned this a little bit last time, is that I know with my work schedule, like, there are days where I am just, like, I'm kind of tethered to a computer for the most part."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"And so, like, I try to do some little things to make sure that, you know, I'm getting some activity."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"And then even if I don't hit 10,000 steps on those days, like, I want to make sure that I get up to, like,"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"you know, as close as possible, and then I, like, make up for it on the other days when I have more flexibility, so just trying to, like, be flexible around what is kind of a weird schedule for me during the week."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,"Yeah, I know that you have definitely mentioned that before, but, you know, you're doing a really great job trying to navigate that, and like I said, this past week was really, really great, so"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"You know, finding things that work for you, you know, like you said, the shopping, that wasn't something that you expected, you know, to really help with that physical activity."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"But as you can see, you know, those kinds of things, you know, just staying active throughout the day really do help there."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,69,advisor,"So in general, you know, I also kind of wanted to ask you about your progress with your weight loss in the study."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,Kind of how are you feeling about that?
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"Um, pretty good."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"I mean, I think there's been a couple of weeks where I feel like there hasn't been like a lot of loss."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"And I know you guys are like one to two pounds a week, like that's like a good healthy way to do it."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"Sometimes it's been, you know, like point eight kind of a thing."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,And
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"Um, you know, so like on a week, I'm not a person who normally is like stepping on a scale that regularly."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"So now that I am, um, even that, like seeing, you know, a week go by and it's not to me, like, I guess not that much, like it can sometimes be a little discouraging, but definitely over the last couple of weeks, I've seen that pick up again."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"Um, so, you know, it's just making that connection in my head between, um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"you know, some of the physical activity and then like what that's turning into."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"So I think the first two weeks, like the first couple of weeks, I was really happy."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,"This last week or so, I've been really happy."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,And so it's just kind of making those changes and getting that balance in place.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"And then another thing that I wanted to ask you about, you know, by the time people generally arrive in week six, you know, they have a"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"good idea of areas that they feel like they need to work on a little bit, you know, some room for improvement."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,"Do you feel like there's something that you specifically feel like you could work on from now until, you know, the end of that 12-week period?"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,Something longer term.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"You know, I think for me it's just going to be a matter of, like, probably –"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"continuing to like change up the types of like exercises that I'm doing and, um, trying to continue to sort of ramp up the like sustained, like higher, um, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"Um, like the level, like you guys gave that scale, like that six to 20 scale or whatever, what's that called?"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,um the rpe the rate of perceived exertion is that what you're talking about yes like the right sorry so yes so like actually just continuing to work on um getting in some workouts that are you know a little more exertion for a little more sustained amount of time like getting on the elliptical a little more and like ramping that up so that's just something that i think i'd been thinking about
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"you know, a little bit the last couple of weeks anyway, but it's something that I just want to keep working toward is making sure that, um, you know, I'm doing things that are a little more rigorous than like, you know, walking, you know, being on the treadmill, but like actually getting into some, you know, biking and things of that nature so that that physical activity is a little more, um, rigorous and sustained in those periods of time that I'm doing them."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,96,advisor,"And I will actually echo your thoughts, you know, um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,"your body gets very used to physical activity quickly, so"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"Definitely, you know, slowly increasing that intensity, whether it's in, like, more intense cardio or some people like to add in some, like, strength training or weightlifting here and there."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,"That's completely up to you, but, yeah, I definitely agree."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,Upping that intensity seems to help.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"But otherwise, you know, so far you've lost eight pounds in the study, so definitely ahead of the curve a little bit."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"Very, very close to your goal, your weight goal for the study."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,"So as long as we just continue the way we're going, I'm sure we'll have –"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,Gotcha.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,"The goal, is that something that I can't remember?"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,Was that something that you guys set based on like starting weight or?
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,So your goal is 183.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,So you are one pound away.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,"So when I say really, oh, I thought you meant like close on track, not like close to meeting it."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,"Oh, wow."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,So we'll kind of talk about how to move forward if you hit that goal next week or when you do hit that goal.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,115,advisor,"But for that next call, if you go ahead and read Lesson 7, and then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,"So actually I've been thinking about this, and I've realized that I'm probably not drinking enough water."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,"Um, so I actually, I don't know if I'm going to track it or if I'm going to like, I got to think for a minute if I'm actually going to track my water intake or if I'm just going to like start setting reminders, but I definitely want to make sure that I'm increasing my, my water."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"I don't drink like a lot during the day, but I drink a lot of coffee in the morning."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"Um, and so I tend to like have the coffee cup in my hand as opposed to having like the water bottle in my hand."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"So, um, I want to make some changes around that."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,121,advisor,"Okay, then for our call next week, if we go back to our Tuesday time, is that okay, or did you want to talk?"
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,122,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,"No, that should work."
Margaret/6070.F.w6.8.23.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,"Okay, so next Tuesday, the 29th at 1, I will check in with you then."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Week 7, just to remind you, agreed to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Lesson 7, were you able to get to that one?"
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,"Shoot, which one was that one?"
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,The one about slip-ups.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,You know what?
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,I don't think I did.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I'm sorry.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"I've had a crazy week, week and a half."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,My entire schedule has been totally messed up the last week and a half.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"And I'm like, oh yeah, no, I didn't do that yet."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"Oh, yeah."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,It's just work schedule has just been weird.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,I've been out of town.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"I've had like, you know, you get into a routine and then all of a sudden, like your routine's completely like fluffed."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"So I've just been the last week, week and a half."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,It's just been crazy.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"And I was like, did I do that?"
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"I'm like, no, I think the last one I did was the week six."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,So I will definitely put that on my calendar to do seven and eight.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,In a row this week.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"Let's see, your previous SMART goal, you had said you wanted to just drink more water."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,Were you able to do that this past week?
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Yeah, a little bit."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,I actually found an app that will do tracking.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,25,advisor,So have you been using that?
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"Yeah, so I started using that, and, you know, I managed to kind of, like, increase over the last couple of days from, like, the first couple of days I used it."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"So that was good, and I think I'm just going to keep, you know, keep using that."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,Awesome.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,"your data, uh, this past week, I saw that you recorded at least a thousand calories all seven days."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"It looks like you made your calorie and fat gram goal, or your calorie goal four of those days, your fat gram goal three of those days."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"Um, so a little bit, yeah, a little bit different than your normal, um, kind of performance."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"Usually, you know, you're pretty good about meeting the goals, so definitely looks like, uh, things were a"
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,"Just kind of thinking about moving forward this week, what are you thinking about doing to get back on track?"
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"You know, in all honesty, it really was just a very weird..."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"A very weird, weird week for me, and I know that my schedule is just not going to be like that."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"Last week, I went down to the cliffs, and we did a road trip down and back in the same day, which literally meant that I was sitting in a car for like 18 or more hours."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"You know, so, like, my activity was down partially because of that."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"I had another event during the week that I had to spend a lot of time getting prepared for, which also meant that I was working extra hours on the days that these things weren't going on, so I was, like, sitting at my... Like, it was just a really strange week for me."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"And even, like, getting into, like, Sunday and this past Sunday and Monday, like, things are sort of back to normal, um..."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,I feel like the past couple of days I've kind of been back on track with both food and activity.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"So, yeah."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"So not really any specific strategy, just, like, you know, giving myself a break for knowing that I had a crazy week and, you know, just making sure that, like, I'm sort of back to what has been my normal for, like, the first six weeks of this."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,you know that's definitely important too just realizing you know that you are going to have those off days and kind of moving forward um that's a little bit what lesson seven actually talks about so maybe you'll relate okay um all right physical activity i saw something recorded all seven days you did 279 minutes so not quite at that 300 minute goal but definitely like you just said you know getting back on track this week uh most recent weight i sees 184 is that correct
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,"Yeah, and it was weird because I actually had gotten, like, down to 183 at one point, like, middle to end of last week, and then over the weekend it seemed to have, like, popped up."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"And then, like, backups, like, 185, 186, and then Monday was, like, back to 184."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"So I don't know if that's just, like, normal fluctuation or if, like, all the extra water had anything."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"Like, I'm just not sure, or if it was just, you know, me sort of having a few days where I was off track, so..."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"Yeah, it could be a lot of different things."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"You know, if you had a lot of salt, it could be that."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"If you were drinking, it could definitely be from that."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"Or sometimes even stress, you know, that makes kind of the weight hang on a little bit or even go up sometimes."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,"So there are a lot of different reasons why, but it does seem like it's going back down since you did jump."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"But I know it can be frustrating, but don't give up, you know."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,You're still doing great.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"No, no, not at all."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"Like I said, between being in a car for 18 hours, 18, 19 hours on Monday, and then I had this event on Thursday, which was just a super fun event."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"It was like, I can't."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"Like, I had no control over what I was eating."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"It's kind of a, you know, everybody was out drinking wine."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"Like, there's a whole lot going on that day, and it was something we had planned for a long time."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,So it's just something to kind of suck up and move on.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"Okay, then our next lessons, seven and eight, and then what would you like your SMART goal to be for the week?"
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"Oh, shoot."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"You know, I hadn't thought about it."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,I don't know.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"You know, actually, this is something I was thinking about the other day because I think I've been talking to you a little bit about not just getting in, like, steps and minutes, but, like, making sure that I'm getting some more sustained, like, heavier activity."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"So I actually did yesterday, I went and worked out in my building's gym a little bit and was just really trying to push up the level of the work."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"So just going faster on the elliptical and popping up the treadmill to a higher speed and things of that nature and sustaining that for a good 10, 15, 20 minutes at a time."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Um, so I think I just want to make sure that I get like a good, I don't know what would be a good number, like at least three of those in three to four of those in, in the week where I'm really like sustained, like 20 minutes at, um, that sort of higher speed, that higher level."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"So I think that, like I said, I did one yesterday, so I can probably do that at least another two times this week just to make sure that I'm amping that up over time."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"Yeah, I definitely think that's a good idea."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"It kind of helps maintain that weight, and, you know, it's just good for overall health to get those more intense workout sessions."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,"Okay, so let's see, next Tuesday, that's going to be the fifth at 1."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,"Yep, absolutely."
Margaret/6070.F.w7.8.29.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,We are in week eight.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,"For our short call today, we'll just be going over our regular agenda."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"So lessons seven and eight, were you able to get to those?"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Yeah, I got caught up."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,Is there anything that you liked from any of them or anything new that you learned?
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"Seven was the flip-up one, which..."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,I feel like I've had a pretty decent handle on just given sort of some of the other lessons previous to that.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"You know, so I think I've been planning and, you know, reacting and things of that nature and not getting too far off track."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"The second one was, lesson eight was the activity one, right?"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,Correct.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,And it's funny because I had actually also just read an article a couple of days ago that came out from NPR where they had done a 10-year study of people just looking at patterns of activity and fitness and things of that nature and effects down the line.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,So it was kind of an interesting parallel study.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,article.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"Um, so it was nice."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,It kind of made me think of a goal for the week.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,So yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"Did you, do you know what your goal for the week is going to be?"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"Um, well, I want to keep going."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Um, really like with what I had said last week around the, you know, at least three days a week of like, you know, having some intensive, you know, long lasting kind of, um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"because I know that it's going to take me a good three weeks of really focusing on that to, like, make that a more, you know, sustainable habit."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"But the other piece that, like, kind of came out of that lesson and came out of that story was just about, like, reminding myself to get up and move more often because there's definitely –"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"You know, times where I'm sitting at work and I will get into a project and, like, sit for two, three hours straight and not move."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"So what I want to do is any time I'm in that situation, whether it be at work or at home, I want to make sure that even if it's not exercise, exercise, that I'm actually, like, forcing myself to get up at least every hour on the hour."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,28,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,29,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,30,advisor,"I think we can all relate to that, kind of just sitting for hours on end at our desk without realizing we probably haven't stood up in the past, like, three or four hours."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,31,advisor,"But good to know, again, that you kind of identified that early on."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,"And that's, you know, not really that difficult to fix, just, you know, getting up once in a while, just walking around."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,Let me go ahead.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,"Oh, and go over your SMART goals."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,So you had said you wanted to do more intense sessions of physical activity at least three to four times this past week.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,So I do see that you met your goal.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"You did 368 minutes across seven days, but did you get those more intense sessions in?"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,"Yeah, I'm going to call it a win."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"I got two good ones in last week, and then I was out of town over the weekend, and I didn't have access to, like, the fitness equipment that I would normally want to, you know, do that with, but I did end up, like, going out in a park where they had some, like, really hilly walking paths, and, like, I hit it really hard, so"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"even though it wasn't like elliptical, like, you know, um, aerobic activity, like I walked at a pretty intensive pace for really significant amount of time."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,And I did kept checking my heart rate and I had my heart rate up pretty hard for most of that.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,"So, um, that, that would be the third one."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,So I'm going to call it a win.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,And then the rest of your data looked pretty good as well.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"So I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories five of the days last week."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"You met your calorie goal four of those days, and then your fat gram goal five of those days."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,Most recent weight I see is 182.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"Oh, did it go to 182?"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,I thought it was 183.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,I'm seeing 182.9.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,"So if you round it, it would be 183, but technically, you know, 182."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,I will say one thing.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"When I went out of town this weekend, I was having weird issues with my phone with the time change because I was in Michigan."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"So when we went over the, you know, the border for the time change, my phone was doing some weird stuff."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"And I noticed that, like, in the app,"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,"Um, like there was something I had eaten like close to midnight one day."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"And then like when I changed time zones, it kind of changed to a different day and then kind of came back."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"And then I also, when I got back into town, I noticed that something else had gotten recorded somehow on a previous day."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"And as I was trying to edit that, um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,um it ended up disappearing so there's a day that shows that i only ate like 700 calories or something but that's because like an entire meal disappeared off of that week or off of that day right so let me just um clarify so you were in michigan and then something was randomly added and then also something was deleted
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"No, so there was two separate things."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"So one thing I had eaten earlier in the week while I was in Chicago, but it was like at 11.45 at night, right?"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,Like I was out playing.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,I had something at 11.45 at night.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,When I changed time zones...
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,where that would have actually been at 12.45 in the morning.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,Like it followed the day.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,"So if I had eaten at 11.45 on, say, Thursday night, it actually then with the time zone showed up on like 12.45 on Friday morning."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"And then, like, moved back."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,That was okay because it seemed to move back fine.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"But it definitely, like, it switched days because of the time zone situation, right?"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,While I was in Michigan.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,The second problem was that I had recorded a lunch on Friday at lunchtime.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"And, um..."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"So it would have been at like 11.45 in the morning, let's just say that."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,And then Friday evening is when I went to Michigan.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"When I got back into town and I was looking at the app again yesterday or today, the thing that I had originally recorded on Friday morning was somehow then sitting on Thursday evening."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"Like, what in the heck happened here?"
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"So then I was like, well, this is horrible because I already had, like, a bad food day on Thursday, and now it adds an entire additional meal."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"It looks like I ate, like, 3,600 calories."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,Right.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,"And I was trying to play with it to see if I could get it to go back, and now it's just like, I don't know what the heck I did in the app, but now that thing is gone."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,Mm-hmm.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,"So my Sunday from last week is now correct, but my Friday is missing an entire meal, and I obviously don't have a way to go back and re-add it."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,92,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,93,advisor,Makes sense.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,So... Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"I know that's a little weird, but yeah."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,So there look to be just some weirdnesses with the time change.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,So... Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,I don't know.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,99,advisor,"I will report that, you know, that's..."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,but yeah but thank you for letting us know you know that helps future participants and of course you know if you ever travel in the future that'll help you as well but you know as long as you know that you're being accountable those days um that's really what's most important um but yeah so going back to your weight you are two pounds down from the last time we checked in so really awesome um still on track with your goals and you know we still have about a month or so left in the study so
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,Everything is looking pretty good.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,"Then for our next call, if you could go ahead and read Lesson 9."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,103,advisor,That one is called Stress Management.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,And then we have your SMART goal down.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,Yep.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"Next Tuesday, that is going to be September 12th at 1."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,Is that going to be okay?
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,"Yeah, that should be fine."
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,Then I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6070.F.w8.9.5.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,"Have a good week, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week nine."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,"Lesson nine, stress management."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"Okay, and what did you think of that lesson?"
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Um, it was good."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"It was kind of a good reminder of some things, um, particularly just around like some of the like planning pieces."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"So, uh, it was good."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"I've had a lot going on, um, with work and some other stuff lately."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,So it was probably a very timely lesson for me.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,11,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Do you feel like your stress level kind of impacts, um, the way that you engage in like any healthy behaviors?"
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,13,advisor,"So like healthy eating, for example?"
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"Well, I think that when I have a whole lot going on and, you know, then there's just a lot of running around."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,There doesn't seem to be as much time for other things.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"And so I'm probably less likely to, like, get to the grocery store."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,So I'm less likely to be stopping at the store and buying fresh produce and things of that nature and relying more on trying to figure out how to eat while I'm out and about.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,So that's probably the biggest impact for me.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,And then let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,Your previous SMART goal.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,"So in general, you said you want to try to be more active throughout the day."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,23,advisor,"So just standing up once in a while, walking around, things like that."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,24,advisor,How did that go?
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,Good.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"I found an app that will, like, beep at me once an hour."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"And so if I haven't been up, then it's, like, in my queue to, like, get up and go do something."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,So that worked out really well.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"So I'm going to keep that on my phone because I've got it so that it does that during, like, all the work days."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"And it'll just, like, chime me once an hour and, you know, then I can act on it."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,So it's been good.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,32,advisor,Alright and then your recording looked really great as well.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,33,advisor,So this past week I saw that you recorded at least 1000 calories all 7 days.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,34,advisor,Then you met your calorie goal all 7 of those days and your fat gram goal 6 of those days.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,35,advisor,So really great job.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,36,advisor,Physical activity really great as well.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,All 7 days recorded you did 386 minutes and then most recent weight I see is 183.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,"It is, but you know what's funny is I actually had gone down like last Thursday, Friday to like 181, like 181.3."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,And then it bumps back up over the weekend.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"And like, I feel like there's this weird plateau happening at the moment."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,42,advisor,Yes.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,"I was actually going to bring that up since, uh, when we checked in last time you were at 182 and then I do see you got down to 181."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,"Uh, but despite meeting the goals very consistently this past week, it does look like you gained a pound."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Um, so like you said, that definitely could be a plateau."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,46,advisor,"Um,"
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,47,advisor,"Do you feel like you've been eating, like, really salty foods recently?"
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,"Or anything that might cause you to, like, retain water or anything like that?"
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,I don't know.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,Maybe.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"I don't... Maybe the whole, like... There has, like I said, like, I haven't been probably to the grocery store as much over the last couple days."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,"So, you know, maybe, you know, eating... Even though I've been eating out and trying to eat out healthy and, like, still making the goals, like, possibly..."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,"There being more sodium in some of that food, I'm not sure."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"So I've noticed the fat amount keeps going down, but the weight seems to plateau a little bit."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,56,advisor,"And I just, you know, generally plateaus are very normal in weight loss."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,It's just kind of your body getting used to whatever you're doing.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"It'll eventually, you know, readjust again."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"But, you know, just some things that we usually tell people, like if you're consuming a lot of alcohol or had any like salty foods or things like that, your body's just going to hold on to some water."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,"So as soon as you kind of get back on track with the types of food that you're eating, so, you know, like you said, going to the grocery store."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,"cooking your own meals, things like that, we should see that weight come back down."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,62,advisor,"But again, it's a really normal process, so not anything to be too worried about, okay?"
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,64,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,65,advisor,"Then for our next call, Lesson 10, that one is called Mindfulness."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,66,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be?
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"So actually, I think I'm going to follow up on this whole last lesson, like the stress management lesson, because..."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"I do have, I have had a lot of stuff going on and I've kind of been in the space of like, I'm running from this thing to that thing and I haven't had a chance to really like, you know, I don't know, kind of, two things I haven't been able to do."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"One is just kind of take a minute and be alone and not have anything going on and like kind of gather myself, but also a little bit of that planning piece."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,I think that when I get to running around the
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,attention to those little things that are directly in front of you and sort of forgetting about the long-term stuff.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,So what I really want to do is just like take a day this week.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"I actually have a day off during the week this week where I can just kind of like not do anything, you know, relax a little bit, but then also kind of reassess where I'm at with a bunch of stuff, you know, do some calendaring, do some planning, and"
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,on some things that maybe I've been neglecting.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"So I think that that will help me a lot sort of moving into the last couple, two or three weeks of this and making sure that I'm calendaring out and have enough time to get the exercise in, the grocery store, and just other stuff."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,77,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,78,advisor,Then let's see.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"Next Tuesday, that is going to be the 19th at 1."
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,Is that okay?
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6070.F.w9.9.12.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"Alright, thank you."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,0,advisor,So we are in week 10.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,2,advisor,Let's see here.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,3,advisor,We'll just be going over your regular agenda.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,4,advisor,So lesson 10 was mindfulness.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,5,advisor,Were you able to get to that one?
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,6,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,7,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,8,advisor,Any big takeaways or any thoughts on that lesson?
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,9,patient,"I think it's, you know, something that everyone should strive for, but it's so hard."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,10,patient,"Like, in this day and age, I feel like we're, like, constantly multitasking and, you know, doing other stuff."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,11,patient,And so...
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,12,advisor,um definitely difficult to do but but something to strive for so yeah yeah and i think most participants really agree with that sentiment um you know we live in such a fast-paced society um it's really hard you know to kind of just take a few minutes to really just sit down and collect your thoughts but definitely you know even the small things like just um eating a bit slower or maybe like taking some time to just eat not eating and
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,13,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,14,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,15,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,16,advisor,So your SMART goal you had said you wanted to maintain over the weekend since you didn't have your scale with you.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,17,patient,How did that go?
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,18,patient,"Yeah, it actually went well."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,19,patient,I was able to stay on track.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,20,patient,I was doing a 200-mile relay race up in Michigan.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,21,patient,"So, yeah, so I was, like, in a van, like, for two days and not, you know, I mean, I was, like, all craziness and, you know, we're just, like, snacking and running and not sleeping and all that."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,22,patient,"But I was, you know, happily still on track on Sunday morning when I was able to weigh myself, so."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,23,advisor,"Actually, looking at your weight, I see you 146."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,24,advisor,So that's actually two pounds down from last time you checked in.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,25,advisor,"So you didn't just maintain, you also lost weight."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,26,patient,"Yeah, exactly."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,27,patient,"So I was glad, yeah."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,28,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,29,advisor,"Then let's see, looking at your data."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,30,advisor,"So five days where you recorded at least 1,000 calories."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,31,advisor,You met your calorie goal two of those days.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,32,advisor,Didn't quite hit your fat gram goal any of those days.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,33,advisor,"Physical activity, seven days recorded."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,34,advisor,You did 497 minutes.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,35,advisor,So definitely met that 300-minute goal.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,37,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,38,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,39,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,40,patient,"No, I think everything's going well."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,41,patient,"I just got a few weeks left, so we'll see how it goes when I'm not on it anymore, but planning on at least keeping some of these healthy habits up."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,42,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,43,advisor,"Then let's see, for your next call, Lesson 11, that one is called Balance Your Thoughts."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,44,advisor,And then what would you let your SMART goals be for you?
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,45,patient,"Yeah, I guess just keep it up, you know, just try and finish strong at the end of the thing."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,46,patient,"So, you know, if I can – my goal, my sort of like inner goal originally was like 150, and then I'm obviously way past that, so I kind of –"
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,47,patient,bumped it back down to like 145 so you know we'll see I'm well on my way to that so um you know I guess that would be the goal to get to that awesome all right then uh to check in with Shirley next week when is a good day and time for you to chat I think we schedule let me look at my calendar yeah we've got it down for Wednesday 11 30 I mean 8 30 so okay yes oh 11 30 no sorry 8 30 I was looking at date is the 11th so yeah 8 30 on Wednesday all right sounds good then she will check in
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,48,patient,"Okay, you too."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,49,patient,"All right, thank you."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,50,advisor,"All right, bye-bye."
Margaret/6074.F.w10.10.05.17.MDforSW.MP3,51,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,0,advisor,"All right, so we are in week seven."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,1,advisor,"Just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,2,advisor,"We'll be going over your regular agenda today, so going over the lessons, talk about your SMART goal, excuse me, all your data."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,3,advisor,So you were asked to read lessons five and six.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,4,advisor,Were you able to get to those by any chance?
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,5,patient,"Unfortunately, I did not."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,6,patient,I can definitely read them before next week.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,7,advisor,"All right, if you could go ahead, those are a little bit lengthy, so just go ahead and read five and six."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,8,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,9,advisor,"And then let's see, your previous SMART goal, so you had said you want to incorporate more vegetables into your meals, so making it about half a portion size."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,10,patient,So how has that been going?
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,11,patient,"Yeah, I think that's been going pretty well."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,12,patient,"Yeah, it's going well."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,13,advisor,"Alright then, let's go ahead and go over your data."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,14,advisor,"So, since the last time you and Shirlene had talked, I saw that you recorded at least 1,000 calories six of the days, and then it looks like you met your calorie goal four of those days and your fat gram goal none of the days, so maybe something that we want to focus on talking about today."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,15,advisor,"So, in general, kind of how has it been trying to meet these goals?"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,16,patient,"Um, it's been, it's definitely been challenging to try to switch out what I'm, um, typically making or eating."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,17,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,18,advisor,Yeah.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,19,advisor,"Um, so specifically kind of, are you having a hard time, like a lot of the foods that you're eating, do you feel like are either high in calories or high in fats?"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,20,patient,I think they're higher in fat than calories is my guess.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,21,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,22,patient,"Um, but you know, maybe that's, that goes hand in hand, maybe because it's high in fat, it's high in calories."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,23,patient,"Um, so I need to be more conscientious of the portion sizes and reduce those or eat something different."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,24,advisor,"I think looking at your data definitely looks, and you know, I even just said calories aren't too bad."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,25,advisor,"It's the fat grams that really may be a little, some substitutions here and there might be helpful."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,26,advisor,"So, you know, generally we tell people there are"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,27,advisor,"certain foods that are just, you know, high in fats, and those are kind of hard to avoid."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,28,advisor,"So things like meat and cheeses, really those are going to be the biggest culprits for those."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,29,advisor,"Do you feel like, you know, you are consuming a lot of those foods?"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,30,advisor,Your diet has a lot of those foods?
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,31,patient,"I mean, I don't – I'm definitely watching what I eat, so –"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,32,patient,"It's surprising that I'm, you know, getting over my fat intake goal."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,33,patient,But I guess so.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,34,advisor,"Yeah, you know, just out of curiosity, when you are recording during the day, do you record foods as you're eating them or do you kind of do it all at the end of the day or maybe in the beginning of the day?"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,35,patient,More of...
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,36,patient,As I'm eating it and then at the end of the day.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,37,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,38,advisor,"Yeah, so I think, you know, just getting a general idea of kind of where the calorie and fat gram contents are coming from in certain foods, I think people find it most helpful to do it in real time."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,39,advisor,"Just because they can really see, you know, what foods have what kind of nutritional content."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,40,advisor,"And then, you know, at the end of the day, they can kind of see where they need to make some changes or maybe cut back on certain things."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,41,advisor,"So maybe that's something that you want to think about or, you know, talk with Charlene about."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,42,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,43,advisor,Physical activity.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,44,advisor,So I saw across four days you did 136 minutes.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,45,advisor,So not quite at that 300-minute goal.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,46,advisor,How has it been trying to get that physical activity in?
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,47,patient,"Well, my Fitbit ran out of batteries last week, unfortunately."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,48,patient,So I've been – I replaced that.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,49,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,50,patient,And have been tracking –
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,51,patient,back on track with that.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,52,patient,"Um, I guess I could have gone back manually and added activity."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,53,patient,"I didn't think of that, but, um, I will be walking a lot next week."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,54,patient,I'll be out of the country traveling and walking a ton.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,55,patient,So I'm not too concerned about getting there.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,56,patient,"Um, next week, at least I won't be going to the gym, but I'll definitely be, um, yeah, getting my steps in."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,57,patient,"Yeah, well, yes, it's a business trip to Berlin, so it'll be a week that I'll be there."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,58,patient,"Oh, wow."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,59,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,60,advisor,"How, so, you know, obviously that is during your time in the study, so kind of how are you thinking about kind of keeping yourself on track while on this trip?"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,61,patient,"Yeah, I was planning to just manually add my weight."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,62,patient,I'm not taking the scale.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,63,patient,"I've tried that on other trips, and it's really hard to attach it to a Wi-Fi."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,64,patient,I'm leaving a scale at home.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,65,patient,But I will track my food as I eat.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,66,patient,"Something that would help me is if I took pictures of what I ate, which is something I'll probably do anyway, to go back and track that at the end of the day."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,67,patient,"You know, try to find something that's approximate."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,68,patient,I think sometimes...
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,69,patient,"instead of tracking exactly what I eat, like, if I make homemade chicken noodle, chicken soup without noodles, like, honestly, it's easier for me to track, like, a can of Campbell's noodles, so even though I'm not, like, eating, like, the content is different of what I'm eating that I'm tracking, like, sometimes I'll make the, I'll try to get something that's approximate to what I ate, so I'll have to be doing a lot of that approximating, like,"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,70,patient,The food.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,71,advisor,"Yeah, and you know, that's generally what we suggest."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,72,advisor,"It's kind of difficult to make it so exact, but as long as it's kind of similar, you know, that's still, you know, the best you can do."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,73,advisor,And that still helps with the weight loss.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,74,advisor,And then I see most recent weight 174.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,75,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,76,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,77,advisor,"Yeah, so that is, it looks like a pound up from the last time that you and Charlene checked in."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,78,advisor,So...
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,79,advisor,"Really, I think at this point, since you do still have some time left in the study, you know, about five or so more weeks, and I think that's a lot of time to make some progress."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,80,advisor,"You know, you're very close to your goal anyway."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,81,advisor,So really paying attention to the fat gram.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,82,advisor,"So again, those meats and cheeses, you know, generally really any dairy product, making some switches here and there is definitely"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,83,advisor,helpful but yeah I actually don't think I've ever heard at least anyone I've talked to mention you know taking pictures of their food so they can record it later but yeah that I think that would be really helpful and that's really interesting so I just want to check in about the text messages are you still receiving those yes all right then for your next check-in if you go ahead and take a look at lessons five and six okay like your smart goals
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,84,patient,"I think what we talked about, taking pictures of my food and then really, you know, committing to tracking during the week and not letting it go."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,85,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,86,advisor,"Yeah, and you know what?"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,87,advisor,"Even if you are going over your goals, I think accurate recording is really the first place to kind of start because then at least you can see, you know, where you need to make some changes and journaling can better help you that way."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,88,patient,Great.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,89,patient,Thank you.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,90,advisor,"Yes, and then for your next call, so next week, when is a good day and time for you to check in?"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,91,patient,"We'll, let's see, I think next Tuesday at 10 a.m."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,92,patient,would be good.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,93,patient,"It'll be like, you know, six hours later there, but that'll work."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,94,patient,10 a.m.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,95,advisor,"next Tuesday, the 12th."
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,96,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,97,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,98,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,99,advisor,put you down for that day and time.
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,100,advisor,"Thank you so much for calling me back and just good luck with everything in the study, okay?"
Margaret/6079.A.w7.9.8.17.MDforSW.MP3,101,patient,"Sure, thank you."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,0,patient,"That was our plan, so I do."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,1,patient,Right.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,2,patient,"I haven't recorded my breakfast, I realize, but otherwise."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,So it looks like we're officially in week one of the study.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"And then I just wanted to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded for these calls, OK?"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,"Yes, no problem."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,7,advisor,"OK, great."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,8,advisor,"So first, we'll be going over the lesson that I asked you to read."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,9,advisor,Then we'll go into any data that you entered and your goals.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,10,advisor,And then we'll go ahead and set your first SMART goal.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"Okay, so already I totally forgot to read the lesson because I was out of town last weekend, so I just totally forgot."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,12,advisor,"Okay, no problem."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,I'll be on.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,14,advisor,"Then I'm just going to ask for our next call that you read Lesson 1 and 2, okay?"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,"Yes, and boy, I'm off to a bad start."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"But yes, Lessons 1 and 2, sorry about that."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,No problem.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,18,advisor,Let's see then to go over your data.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,19,advisor,So before we do that...
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,I'm looking at your data right now.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,I do see that you're entering in all of your weight manually.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,Does that mean the scale is not working still?
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Yeah, it still says it's not synced."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,"And actually, I had a moment of total panic."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,I took it with me.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"You know, I weighed myself Friday, took it with me Saturday and Sunday to be at my parents' house."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"And, you know, the truth is I've got carpeting everywhere, and I wasn't keeping track of the food."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"So I thought, because I knew our study started yesterday..."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"And so I got back, and let's see, yesterday morning is Monday."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,"So I stepped on the scale, and it was like eight pounds heavier."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"And I was like, holy cow, I, you know, after all these years, you have a sense of how you're doing without weighing."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"So I took it, brought it back downstairs next to my computer, and then it three times went through an update."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,"And then, so then I stepped on it again and it was, and that's the weight I recorded."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,I think it was 191.7.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"Yeah, that."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"And so, and then it did the check mark after it, but it also still says I'm weighing in as a guest."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,"But it can say, and this morning it said weighing in as a guest."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,And on my phone...
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,"You know, when I go into the application, which, by the way, your food application is pretty slick."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"I'm, you know, I've done this once before with a different application, but this one is working pretty, it's gotten easier for me to use."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,43,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,44,advisor,I'm glad to hear that.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"I know that was one of your concerns, so I'm good that that's working out."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,"I mean, I feel like I'm putting in a lot of custom foods, but I'm figuring out ways how to put them in."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,"And, you know, remembering, because, again, I had mentioned that I find over a course of a week I don't vary a lot, maybe different things within the same food groups."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"But a lot of the things that I'm trying to focus on, the vegetables and things, are already in there."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,So it's pretty straightforward.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,I'm really sorry about the scale.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,I'm not quite sure what is going on there.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"So, as I told you, you know, I actually paid someone to come to my house who does this, and he had a heck of a time."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"So I'm, you know, maybe, I don't know."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"Do you have a lot of people with a lot of success, and I'm just one of your outliers?"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,57,advisor,Um...
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,"We've had a few different people, not the same problem that you're having, but other people have definitely said that they've been having issues."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,One thing that we've discovered and this was not something that we had any foresight about was that the ARIA scale works with very specific types of routers.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,60,advisor,It could be entirely possible that yours isn't compatible with the ARIA.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,61,advisor,That's just not something that we were even aware of when we had decided to use the ARIA scale as part of our study.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"Boy, everything has personalities, even electronic equipment, huh?"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,Exactly.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,So I have an AT&T router that's a little older.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,maybe three years.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,So maybe that's something to do with it?
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,67,advisor,"It's, you know, I'm not involved in tech, so I can't really tell you exactly, but there's like a specific type of like gateway or something."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,68,advisor,"So in order to figure out if your router was compatible with the ARIA scale, you'd have to like call AT&T, ask them all these questions."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,So I would much rather just manually input if you don't mind.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,70,advisor,"Right, which, yeah, that is fine with us."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"It's, you know, whether the weight comes in manually or through the scale, of course, one is more convenient, but, you know, for data purposes, it's the same to us."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"I'm really glad that this phone app is working, right, because you're obviously reading all my stuff on that."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"One thing I didn't hear back from you, you know, when you asked me to try these things, did you get my answer?"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,I had sent it to you on July 13th.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,75,advisor,"It might have gotten lost in the, let's see."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,76,advisor,"Oh, is it the weight you put in on 329, 2015?"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"So my app is still the same weight, which is fine."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"You know, maybe the app and the scale just aren't going to ever talk to each other."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"But again, if I'm also running into trouble with my router, you know, I'm not looking to prove that we can make all this equipment work as long as you are content with my, you know, honesty and consistency about just putting in the weight, which I am trying to do the minute I weigh so that I'm... Yes, that's perfectly fine with us."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,"You know, I'm just sorry that, of course, having to just say it manually is way more convenient, but..."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,82,advisor,"But we do appreciate, you know, that you are taking the time to put it in manually."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,83,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,84,advisor,Then I'm going to go ahead and go over your data.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,85,advisor,"So since your intervention just started yesterday, I'm only going to look at yesterday."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,86,advisor,"So just to remind you, your calorie budget is 1,500 calories."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,87,advisor,Your fat gram budget is 42 grams of fat.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,88,advisor,"Looking at yesterday, I do see that you recorded at least 1,000 calories, which is good."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,89,advisor,"Remember, we had said we want everyone to eat at least that amount, so you did do that."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"And then it does look like you did meet your calorie and fat drink goal, so that's great."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,91,advisor,How are you feeling so far about these goals?
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"Well, so I'm not having any trouble with it."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"I will say it's just so helpful to have the calorie countdown because I did practice with it last week, and, you know, it –"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"For example, I was home over the weekend and a glass of wine."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,I had a board meeting last night and came home and definitely had a glass of wine after that.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,And it's a lot of empty calories.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,"So, you know, all of this makes me very mindful of what are my choices."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,And certainly I'm finding that I do better with...
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"You know, I don't sit down and eat three meals a day."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,"I tend, not graze, but I tend to do, especially during the workday, the snacks and I take pre-prepared, measured things like I just did two cups of strawberries and then I'm doing a cup of blueberries to take so that I can have those and then I keep yogurt at work so that I always have a healthy snack."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,I...
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,"Again, I practiced a week ago."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,"I was a little surprised I didn't drop more weight, and I think that's, to me, the big bell ringing that I've got to work on focusing on activity because I think that's going to be the game changer for me."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,Good to hear that everything's going okay so far.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,"And, yeah, you have a very good..."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,107,advisor,"You have a lot of room right now, actually, with the calories."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,108,advisor,"You know, yesterday you were only at around 1,200, and you were only at 35 grams of fat."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,109,advisor,"So, you know, even if you wanted to eat a little bit more, I think that would be okay."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,110,advisor,"But so far, so good."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,111,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,112,advisor,Physical activity is doing well.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,113,advisor,"Also, I see one day entered yesterday and then 13 minutes total."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,114,advisor,So.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,"So that's all... Yeah, that's... But the previous week when I was practicing all this, I noticed my steps didn't really change other than... Because what you're seeing is just my normal walking during the course of the day."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,And I think it's a real wake-up call.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,"After a week of practicing the previous week, I didn't see any movement off my 12 steps or what I was given for just living life."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,And so that's getting back to the... I'm going to have to...
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"put in my schedule, make sure I'm doing some other kind of exercise to get up to the 60."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,120,advisor,"Yeah, remember we had said we want those physical activity minutes to be at a certain rate of exertion, so the Fitbit kind of keeps track of that itself."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,121,advisor,"So maybe just, you know, your regular walking kind of isn't up to that."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,"Well, it's just, right, right, so I'm going to have to work on that."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,123,advisor,"Right, yeah, and of course, you know, any physical activity is good."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,124,advisor,"Just for weight loss, we encourage a certain type of exertion, but, you know, you're aware of that very early on, so everything looks okay there as well."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,125,advisor,"And then most recent weight, I see that 191.2, correct?"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,"Right, that was this morning."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,"So, yeah, like I said, everything is looking pretty good right now in terms of calories and fat grams."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,Even food choices look very good.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,130,advisor,Is there anything that you wanted to talk about on this call in specific?
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,"I don't have, you know, much to bring up just yet since I only have a day of days worth of data."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,132,patient,No.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,"Again, now that we're settled that I'm not going to keep trying to somehow figure out the scale other than I just use it, then I'm just going to –"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,to move forward and not use that as a stress point in my day.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,"And then, you know, my goal for next week would be to definitely see if I can't get to the 60 minutes, which, again, after doing this for a week and thinking, whoa, I walk a lot each day, it's not enough, and so I'm going to have to ratchet that up."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,"Because I, you know, I rarely gorge on food, but obviously, you know, I haven't lost any weight either, so..."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,not just in this study but generally.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,"So I'm going to, you know, that's the whole point of this three-month study is to see if I can't really get over a hump and drop some weight."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,Exactly.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,140,advisor,"Okay, then for our next call, if you could go ahead and, like I said, read Lessons 1 and 2."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,141,patient,"1 and 2, yes, and apologies."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,142,patient,"You know, so because I didn't read 1, remind me again where it is."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,"Yes, so to access the lessons, you can either go to the URL that was provided"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,144,patient,"In that folder, yeah."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,"Or if you go into the Smart app and you go to the home page, click on the gear in the top left corner."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,146,patient,"Ah, okay."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,147,patient,"If you scroll down, it'll say Smart Lessons."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,148,patient,You can just click on that.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,149,patient,All right.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,150,patient,"So, yes, I promise I will read one and two."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,151,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,152,patient,"Well, so I gave myself yet another goal."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,153,patient,"Actually, you know, do the instruction."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,154,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,155,advisor,And then we can go ahead and set your first SMART goal.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,156,advisor,"So remember, this is something that we'll be doing"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,157,advisor,You had mentioned that you really wanted to get the 60 minutes of physical activity in.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,158,advisor,Did you want to make that your SMART goal?
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,159,patient,"Yes, yes, for heaven's sakes."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,160,patient,I want that to be a consistent goal.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,161,patient,"But, yes, again, now after I've done this for a week, I realize that I have to be mindful about it."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,162,patient,It's just not naturally occurring in my routines.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,163,patient,"So, yes, that would be my goal is that next week you're going to be, wow, you met your goal."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,164,patient,And you also did your homework.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,165,advisor,"All right, and then for that call next week, does this time generally work for you?"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,166,patient,"Actually, I was hoping we would move it to 9 o'clock on Tuesdays and that that would be sort of a standing call unless you or I were off."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,167,advisor,"Yes, 9 o'clock on Tuesdays is going to be fine."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,168,advisor,Is this still the same number that you want me to call on?
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,169,patient,"Yes, I want you to call me on myself so that if for some reason I'm not directly at my desk calling, I think this is a better option."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,170,advisor,Then I'll put you down for next Tuesday.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,171,advisor,That's the 25th at 9.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,172,advisor,I will check in with you then.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,173,advisor,"Have a great week, okay?"
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,174,patient,"And the same to you, Margaret."
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,175,patient,Thanks for calling.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,176,patient,No problem.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,177,patient,All righty.
Margaret/6085.F.w1.7.17.17.MD.MP3,178,patient,Bye.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"So, week 10, just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"So, we're really, you know, down to the wire here."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,Maybe just about two more calls left.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,3,advisor,Let's see.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,4,advisor,"Lesson 10, mindfulness."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,5,advisor,"So, you said you got to that one."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"So, actually, it was good."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,"I mean, some of the stuff, you know, for me, when I'm going through these lessons, I'm looking for tricks and tips and things like that."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,"And you do pick up some, you know."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,"But I'm not sure I'm totally invested in mindfulness anyway generally, but, you know, to sit there and think about the swallowing motion and all that, I'm like, no, eating is a necessity, but I don't want it to be just gourmet experience or, you know, envisioning swallowing and stuff like that, because to me that just prolongs it or reminds me that I have to scale back quite a bit."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"Anyway, but there were some tips."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"For example, my habit, again, we don't have children at home anymore, so my habit is come home and, you know, sit and read the paper while I eat or do it while I'm on the computer, so I'm trying to avoid that."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,"And then one thing I do do is prepare and measure food in advance, so like in the morning when I grab my lunch, it's ready, you know, like the salad's made, it's pre-measured and all that."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,That's when I do really well.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,15,patient,drinking the water.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"I try and, if I'm getting really hungry, which I feel like I am all the time, I, you know, try and do the eight ounces of water, just a big drink, because that, you know, quenches something, I don't know."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,17,patient,"And then also, before eating, I try and do that."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,"Then the shopping things, I'm definitely more focused on the shopping list and really try and only buy"
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,the stuff that I think I need so that I prepare some menus in advance.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,20,patient,"And, you know, it says only go to the grocery store, but that's impractical."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,21,patient,"So if nothing else, it's hard to get fresh fruits and stuff like that the last week."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,22,patient,"So I rather than buy a huge amount, if I have to go back to the grocery store, I only go into that section and then spin around and walk out."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,I am definitely more mindful about reading labels on things.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,I do frozen meals like lean cuisines and Weight Watchers because I only eat so many salads at lunch.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,"But I'm aware that like in lean cuisine, which of course tastes better, it's much higher in sodium."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"And I'm noticing that I'm so much more sensitive to salt in food, especially prepared food, because I haven't been eating it like that."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Let's see, mindful labels."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,So I'm definitely looking at the fat grams.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,"So part of the success of this study for me has been the awareness of fat grams and trying to, you know, the calories are easier, but that's the one thing people have always focused on."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,But the fat grams has really made a difference for me.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,"Let's see, mindful eating."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"Well, it's okay, but I don't want to be so focused on swallowing feathers."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,I already told you that.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,"Also, the whole study, the smart tips about, again, you can track your calories, recording, also the exercise component that goes with it."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"I really had done this once before, but I really like this smart tip or whatever, the app and the activity tracker."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,I think that's been very effective for me.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,37,advisor,Great.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,38,advisor,"And then, let's see, your previous SMART goal, so you said you'd really want to hit that physical activity goal."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,39,advisor,"So looking at your physical activity, enter across seven days, I saw 222 minutes, so not quite at that 283."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,Whoa!
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,That's not right.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,I got to 290-something.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,When did you refresh?
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,I don't know if I can go back.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,45,advisor,"Just this morning, and since it's last week."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,Can I go into it from the previous week?
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,48,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,49,patient,"Also, my scale is giving me all kinds of problems."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,50,patient,Are you?
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,51,patient,"If I go into the 18th Monday, so let me go to the previous week."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,52,patient,I don't know.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,53,patient,I don't know if I can go back.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,54,patient,"Oh, here we go."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,55,patient,"17, Barbara."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,It won't let me go back into my history.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,"Yeah, I was at 287 last week."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,58,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,59,advisor,"Maybe there's something wrong with our website since, you know, we just pulled data, so it might not be pulling it completely."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,"Yeah, my phone app tells me on Saturday, the 17th,"
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,I was at 287 for footsteps because I was very mindful of that.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,"Okay, great."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,"To credit one, I do do something right."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"And then, you know, it included things like I've been doing a massive amount of yard work, which is raking and stuff like that."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"And so I did have a couple of manuals, but a lot of it's been just, you know, mindful walking and really making sure I'm taking those steps."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,So I felt like I met that goal.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,"Wasn't quite doing 10,000 steps today, but I was getting the activity in because I did swimming once and then, again, a bunch of yard work that I put in that time."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,So there's that.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,I think that was pretty good.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,What else can you say about calories and fat neurons for the week?
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,71,advisor,"Yeah, that was really great."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,72,advisor,"So 1,000 calories recorded all seven days."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,73,advisor,You met your calorie goal six of those days and your fat gram goal seven of those days.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,Right.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Well, the fat fam was surprisingly a lot easier."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,"The calories, yeah, went over on Saturday or something, I think, right?"
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,"Right, yeah, just about by 300 or so calories."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,"I was surprised at that, but again, you know, because you're kind of keeping a ticker going in your head, but oh well."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,79,advisor,"Yeah, well, you know, really impressive, especially you had guests in town."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,80,advisor,"And also, I'm so sorry about the funeral."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,81,advisor,I hope everybody...
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"Well, it was a friend of my sister's."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,"It was one of these where he went into stomach pains, and nine days later he was dead from amyloidosis or whatever."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,It's that thing where your body creates a protein that then kills off your organs.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,"And he, yeah, it was really fast."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,He was only 55.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"So he's in my world, he's really young."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,So what else?
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,I realize I'm cutting into your time.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,90,advisor,"No, I have a lot of time this morning, so it's okay, but did you feel like, you know, while these guests were in town, you were having any problems trying to stick to the goals, or do you feel like you're kind of now really cemented in your behaviors?"
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"Well, first of all, I found that they were, I didn't go to the funeral, so they were paying and using us as a bed and breakfast, pretty much."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,"And, but I found that I just wasn't, like I got a coffee cake and then, but I had two or three different kinds of fruit."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,"So, you know, you change what you're offering people."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,And so I find that I'm just doing that and it's just not a big deal.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"You know, I don't make, I don't talk to people about being on this thing at all."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"So, you know, it's just doing my thing and it's not a big deal."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,97,patient,So that wasn't a problem.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,98,patient,"And, you know, it's been easier to meet all these fat grams and stuff because I just haven't been eating out."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"You know, we haven't had occasions to do that."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,100,patient,And so that's always easier when you can control the food in the house.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,101,patient,"A little discouraged that I haven't dropped more weight because, I mean, I am really paying attention."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,102,patient,But I feel like I've plateaued again for a while.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,And so...
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,104,patient,"You know, my hope is."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,105,patient,"But the scale, you know, every day I step on it and it tells me I'm 183.6."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,106,patient,And I know I'm not.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,So I've had to put it in manually several times.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,"And the only one day last week I let it record because after stepping on the scale like three or four times, it finally gave me a recording that kind of matched what my own personal scale is."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,And so I just kind of went with that.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,So I don't know what's going on with the scale.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,"I have an appointment in two weeks or whatever, the 12th, right?"
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,Do you?
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,Let's see.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,I do.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,It's my three-month thing.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,Do I bring the scale back at that point to you?
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"Yes, you do."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"Okay, well, I thought I literally liked it a lot, but now it's not my friend anymore."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,Hopefully it's okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,"But, again, with all the trouble we had setting it up,"
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,And we talked about this last week.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,I'm not interested enough for only two weeks left.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,"You know, I'll keep trying to use it."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,But the fact that it keeps going at a certain weight every single time leads me to believe it's not working right.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,127,advisor,"Yeah, it's probably something with the manufacturing or the insides or whatever is not working."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,But we'll check it out.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,129,patient,"Yeah, but there's nothing."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,"I mean, it's, you know, in 15 condition."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,131,patient,It's just it's not been dropped.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,132,patient,"But, you know, the fact that it keeps going back to that one measurement just leaves me to believe."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,133,patient,"But anyway, so that's been a little bit of frustration."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,"But like I said, I've got my own personal scale because that's what I'm going to be left with after two weeks."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,"So I'm continuing to use that, and it tells me what I think I know in my heart."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,136,advisor,"Yeah, so your weight, I see 179, is that correct?"
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,137,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,"Yep, so that is two pounds down."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,139,patient,"But, yeah, I'm feeling good."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,140,patient,"I really, really want to get down to the 170, so I'm..."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,141,patient,"You know, I'm continuing to march on."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,142,advisor,Awesome.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,"Okay, so another great week down."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,"Just kind of keep, continue to do what you're doing."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,145,advisor,"Let's see, for our call next week, Lesson 11."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,146,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,147,advisor,And then what would you like your SMART goal to be?
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,148,patient,"Continue, I'd like to be down two pounds."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,149,patient,"So that's my goal, but I want to make sure I'm doing it the right way and"
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,150,patient,"You know, I'm aware that I've got to do the minimum of 1,000 calories and stuff, but that's one of the reasons I've been trying to reduce my fat grams because I've got to believe that's helping some."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,151,patient,"But I am still doing the calories, and it's, you know, that's my goal."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,152,patient,"And then to certainly meet my step goal, which I'm sorry you're not agreeing with at the moment, but my phone does say that."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,153,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,154,patient,"And in fact, I should see..."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,155,patient,So it set my goal back to 300 for this week.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,156,patient,"So if it truly only was to whatever yours is going, it wouldn't have bought me 70 minutes."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,157,advisor,"Yeah, that's true."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,158,advisor,I do see that your goal for this week is 300.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,159,advisor,So you did obviously meet your goal.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,160,patient,"Well, I got it four minutes over because it was 283 and I clocked in at 287."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,161,patient,put that in your notes but um so anyway i'm doing lesson 11 next week yes okay all right and then let's see next tuesday is the 26th is that okay no next tuesday should be oh yes in september sorry yes yes yes i was over i'm like holy cow uh yes that's my plan all right then i will talk to you next week have a good week okay thank you sorry for those starts and stops this morning no it's
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,162,patient,All right.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,163,patient,"Thanks, Margaret."
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,164,patient,You too.
Margaret/6085.F.w10.9.19.17.MD.MP3,165,patient,Bye-bye.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,0,advisor,"Week 11, just to remind you, you did agree to be audio recorded."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,1,advisor,"Lesson 11, balance your thoughts."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,2,advisor,What did you think of that one?
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,3,patient,"Actually, I thought there were some – let's see, I'm looking at my notes."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,4,patient,"Oh, you know, long ago I –"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,5,patient,That I don't have to be perfect.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,6,patient,I don't deserve credit for every positive action station that I walk in.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,7,patient,"Oh, I do deserve it, rather, because I always think whenever I'm not walking or I turn away from, you know, or the choice, you know, make a choice, that that's a good thing because I could be, you know, further behind."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,8,patient,And then it says the three things when you do stay off the path.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,9,patient,I have said this to myself.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,10,patient,deserve to rest.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,11,patient,"No one will see and the third thing is people depending on me, I deserve this."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,12,patient,"You know, because I, you know, I have a stressful death."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,13,patient,So I have to solve it.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,14,patient,"You know, our connection is really fuzzy."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,15,advisor,"Yeah, I was going to say, you sound a little far away."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,16,patient,"You know, I was just talking to my mother earlier."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,17,advisor,I got my volume up a quiet half an hour.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,18,patient,I usually talk to you on speakerphone.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,19,patient,Is this better?
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,20,advisor,"No, you sound a little more far away now."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,21,advisor,"Wow, there's... Hang on, let me just take that."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,22,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,23,patient,"Okay, now I'm back."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,24,patient,Are you?
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,25,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,26,patient,"All right, well, my speakerphone must not be working right now."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,27,patient,"Anyway, it's because I tuck it in my phone in my brassiere, and when I go walking, I've got it with me because I found I don't have enough walking pants with pockets in them."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,28,patient,"Anyway, so maybe it's gotten sweaty."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,29,patient,So I told you the three things that I have said to myself to stray off the path.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,30,patient,Some things to keep in mind is I don't have to give myself permission to stray.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,31,patient,Sometimes I just do it.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,32,patient,"I always feel bad after a walk, and I have to be careful to remember to treat myself with healthy foods."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,33,patient,I actually am not enjoying bad foods anymore.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,34,patient,I eat it and I think that wasn't really worth it.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,35,patient,"So, for example, we had Chinese takeout Saturday night and I didn't enjoy it as much as I have in the past."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,36,patient,"And I think part of it is I'm just so, so, so, so focused on what goes in my mouth that, you know, I'll eat something and I'll think, yeah, that wasn't worth it."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,37,patient,"So I think that's a positive change, actually."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,38,patient,And then the three positive changes are
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,39,patient,that I have done is this recording.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,40,patient,I'm very committed to recording everything.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,41,patient,I am definitely eating less.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,42,patient,"I notice that I'm not starved when I wake up in the morning, or at least I've convinced myself that I'm not."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,43,patient,"And I'm definitely walking more, but I'm being honest with myself about recording everything."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,44,patient,The behavior change is definitely eating less.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,45,patient,and I'm definitely more planned about food intake.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,46,patient,"You know, I prepare food in advance, like I already have, you know, I'll buy a batch of strawberries, and I'll clean them, cut them, and put them in one-cup servings so that when I leave in the morning to get to work, I just am grabbing things that are already prepared rather than thinking that I'm going to make my salad in the morning or something."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,47,patient,And that's all I took notes on.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,48,advisor,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,49,advisor,"And then, let's see, your previous SMART goal, just wanted to stick to the goals, keeping your fat grams low, so that seems to be most helpful."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,50,advisor,"Looking at your data, really great this past week."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,51,advisor,"You know, you recorded"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,52,advisor,"1,000 calories all seven days."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,53,advisor,You met your calorie and fat gram goal all seven days.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,54,advisor,So really great job.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,55,advisor,Do you feel like there was anything you did in specific this past week to kind of help you achieve that?
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,56,patient,"So I had my goal of losing two pounds, and by golly, I was going to do it."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,57,patient,I'm not sure I did.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,58,patient,"But, you know, I'm kind of blacked out again where, you know, I can't seem to get beyond losing 12 pounds."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,59,patient,The scale and I are not getting along whatsoever.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,60,patient,I can't wait to give it back to you.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,61,patient,"I mean, I would say 80% of the time it tells me I'm 183.6."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,62,patient,It's always that.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,63,patient,And that's just wrong.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,64,patient,"And so, plus, I'm gladly handing it over on the 12th."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,65,patient,"So, you know, I'm back to relying on my scale at home because that's what it's going to be."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,66,patient,"I've heard different things about people saying, oh, you shouldn't weigh yourself every day."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,67,patient,But I guess I kind of need that motivation because...
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,68,patient,"For example, I think I've been doing great, and I'm just not seeing that much movement on the scale."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,69,patient,"You know, I was talking to my mom."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,70,patient,My clothes are fitting much better.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,71,patient,I can see it on my chest and stuff like that.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,72,patient,"But, you know, no one's walking up saying, wow, you've lost weight."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,73,patient,"She assures me it's because I'm short, and people just don't see it as dramatically, that if I get to 25, which is my ultimate goal, then people will notice."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,74,patient,"So, anyway, that's it."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,75,patient,"Um, so I don't know why I went off on that tangent."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,76,patient,What did you ask me?
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,77,patient,I was asking if you were doing anything specific.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,78,patient,Why did I tell you about my mother?
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,79,patient,"Um, so I just think I'm really, I'm just so focused on it was all the things that I said I didn't want to do, which was, you know, every morsel that goes into my mouth."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,80,patient,"But gee, I am thinking that right now and really trying to make the smart choices."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,81,patient,I don't feel that I'm
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,82,patient,"being denied because, again, back to my earlier comment of, you know, eating, quote, bad foods doesn't give me the pleasure anymore that it used to because I've got this bigger goal."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,83,patient,I really want to make a permanent change.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,84,patient,"And so anyway, it wasn't that hard."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,85,patient,And certainly I'm trying to stay up to that because I'm just trying to move the scale some more.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,86,patient,"And, you know, I walk quite a bit, went swimming."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,87,patient,"You know, and I'm just not seeing the rewards."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,88,patient,So I can't even imagine what I'd be if I wasn't doing all that stuff.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,89,patient,But I'm not giving up.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,90,patient,I just feel like I'm doubling down.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,91,patient,"I keep in mind that I've got to at least eat 1,000 calories because, you know, you'd almost want to go on starvation rations."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,92,patient,Just to say I've moved the scale.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,93,patient,But I want it to also be something that's sustainable.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,94,patient,"And I know that it wouldn't be sustainable if I, you know, drop a big amount and then,"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,95,patient,"You know, go back to trying to live a more normal life or even eating 1,000 calories a day."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,96,patient,"So, you know, I'm trying to do that."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,97,advisor,"Yeah, so I wanted to ask you about the scale."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,98,advisor,"It's giving you a reading, but it's just the same reading every week?"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,99,patient,"Yeah, every day, 183.6."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,100,advisor,"Yeah, so we've actually had some participants complain that the scale will say error after a while, which means the scale is completely broke."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,101,advisor,"And we contacted Fitbit about it, and they just said, you know, the scale breaks."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,102,advisor,That's just what happens.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,103,patient,"I'm sorry, but I think I have a brand new scale, and it only didn't even last three months."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,104,advisor,Right.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,105,advisor,"Yeah, that's what they've been telling us."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,106,advisor,"So it's interesting, though, that yours is still working, but, you know, you're saying it's giving you the wrong."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,107,patient,"Well, and then I'll say, no, it's not you lying dog."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,108,patient,"And so then I step off of it and I step on again and it'll go to, you know, maybe to 182 or 181."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,109,patient,"And again, I'm using the second scale now and I know, you know, I know that that scale is right."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,110,patient,And it's still...
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,111,patient,"You know, it'll change a little bit, but it won't go to what I think the scale should be."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,112,patient,"Like, it should have been 178 the other day, and, you know, it said 183.6."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,113,patient,"Then it went to, like, 182."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,114,patient,"It was like it was inching down to say, all right, well, let's negotiate."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,115,patient,"And so the other thing is, one thing that doesn't mean anything to me now, but you know how it goes, check, does my initials, and it gives me a percentage."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,116,patient,Is that body fat percentage?
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,117,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,118,patient,"Oh, okay."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,119,patient,"Well, anyway."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,120,patient,"That's not very accurate, though, so I wouldn't... Well, you know, nothing about that scale is anymore."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,121,patient,It does get my initials right.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,122,patient,"But I'm, you know, I'm just not even relying on that anymore, especially because I'm so close to the end."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,123,patient,"If I were owning that scale, I'd say, all right, let's try this again."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,124,patient,"But I'm a little discouraged that Fitbit's response to you, who probably purchased a slew of them, is, oh, well, they break."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,125,patient,So we'll kind of see.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,126,patient,"Sorry, that's for you."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,127,patient,I'm glad I didn't invest in it.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,128,advisor,We'll kind of see what's going on when you return it.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,129,advisor,Sorry about the inconvenience.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,130,patient,"Well, it's not an inconvenience, but I'm just telling you that's why you see manual all the time."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,131,advisor,"Right, which is fine."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,132,advisor,178 I see today.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,133,advisor,Is that correct?
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,134,patient,"Yeah, but it inched up a little bit, right?"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,135,patient,The day before it was like a half pound up or something.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,136,patient,"Yeah, so anyway, I don't know if I'm, like, so hypersensitive that I retain salt or what, but anyway, so yeah."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,137,advisor,"Well, you're still a pound down from the last time we checked in, so."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,138,patient,"I know, but I was hoping for two, and, you know, of course, it didn't happen, but anyway."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,139,advisor,Small wins are just as good.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,140,patient,"I guess, I guess."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,141,patient,"You're right, and so anyway, that's where I'm at."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,142,patient,But the scale is not my friend.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,143,advisor,"And then physical activity across six days, you did 319 minutes."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,144,advisor,So good job.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,145,patient,"Yeah, I did good."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,146,patient,"Well, again, though, I had to throw in swimming."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,147,patient,"And, you know, who knows?"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,148,patient,"I mean, the foot measure, the walking is always the most accurate measurement."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,149,patient,"But because, I mean, it just literally counts steps."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,150,patient,But the swimming is always kind of hard to judge.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,151,patient,"I mean, for me, you know, I think I'm kind of out of breath when I'm done."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,152,patient,But I'm not sure I'm...
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,153,patient,exerting the same energy every single stroke I take.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,154,patient,"On the other hand, I'm in the pool because of this study, so, you know, there's good stuff."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,155,patient,"Gardening, I do a lot of yard work, and that's kind of hard to measure, but still, I'm outside."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,156,patient,"I don't even put in all the time that I spend out in the yard because, you know, exertion is a hard thing to judge."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,157,patient,"So those things are a little trickier, but definitely was trying to get my minutes out there, so I did that."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,158,patient,"So when I get kicked off the study,"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,159,patient,"I will still be able to use your app, right?"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,160,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,161,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,162,patient,"And then do you continue to collect data from it, or is it now just between me and my app?"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,163,advisor,We continue to collect data.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,164,advisor,"You will have access to the app, but whether or not you want to use it for the entire 12 months is completely up to you."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,165,patient,"But I can if I want to, right?"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,166,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,167,patient,Or at least until I get my 25 pounds off.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,168,patient,Yep.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,169,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,170,patient,Okay.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,171,patient,"At the rate I'm going, it might take me the year, but by golly, I'm going to do it."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,172,advisor,We'll see.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,173,patient,Yeah.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,174,advisor,All right.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,175,advisor,"So for our next call, Lesson 12, Weight Loss Plateau, and then what would you like your SMART goals to be for the week?"
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,176,patient,I'd still like to do the two pounds.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,177,patient,"I've got to get rewarded at some point, and that's what motivated me this past week."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,178,patient,So I've got to assume suddenly the body's going to kick in.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,179,advisor,"And then for our call next week, that's going to be October 3rd at 9."
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,180,advisor,Is that okay?
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,181,patient,Yes.
Margaret/6085.F.w11.9.26.17.MD.MP3,182,patient,And this will be our last one?
